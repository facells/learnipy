y,Contrary to other reviews  I have zero complaints about the service or the prices. I have been getting tire service here for the past 5 years now  and compared to my experience with places like Pep Boys  these guys are experienced and know what they re doing. \nAlso  this is one place that I do not feel like I am being taken advantage of  just because of my gender. Other auto mechanics have been notorious for capitalizing on my ignorance of cars  and have sucked my bank account dry. But here  my service and road coverage has all been well explained - and let up to me to decide. \nAnd they just renovated the waiting room. It looks a lot better than it did in previous years. 
n,Last summer I had an appointment to get new tires and had to wait a super long time. I also went in this week for them to fix a minor problem with a tire they put on. They  fixed  it for free  and the very next morning I had the same issue. I called to complain  and the  manager  didn t even apologize!!! So frustrated. Never going back.  They seem overpriced  too. 
y,Friendly staff  same starbucks fair you get anywhere else.  Sometimes the lines can get long. 
n,The food is good. Unfortunately the service is very hit or miss. The main issue seems to be with the kitchen  the waiters and waitresses are often very apologetic for the long waits and it s pretty obvious that some of them avoid the tables after taking the initial order to avoid hearing complaints. 
y,Even when we didn t have a car Filene s Basement was worth the bus trip to the Waterfront. I always find something (usually I find 3-4 things and spend about $60) and better still  I am always still wearing the clothes and shoes 3 months later. \n\nI kind of suspect this is the best shopping in Pittsburgh; it s much better than the usual department stores  better than Marshall s and TJ Maxx and better than the Saks downtown  even when it has a sale. Selection  bargains AND quality.\n\nI like this Filene s better than Gabriel Brothers  which are harder to get to. Gabriel Brothers are a real discount shopper s challenge and I m afraid I didn t live in Pittsburgh long enough to develop the necessary skills . . . Filene s was still up and running in June 2007 when I left town. 
y,Picture Billy Joel s  Piano Man  DOUBLED mixed with beer  a rowdy crowd  and comedy - Welcome to Sing Sing!  A unique musical experience found in Homestead.\n\nIf you re looking to grab a bite to eat or a beer  come on in!  Serving food and brews from Rock Bottom Brewery  Sing Sing keeps your tummy full while you listen to two (or more) amazingly talented pianists take your musical requests.  They ll play anything you d like  for tips of course.  Wanting to hear Britney Spears?  Toto?  Duran Duran?  Yep  they play that... new or old.\n\nThe crowd makes the show  so make sure you come ready for a good time.  If the crowd is dead  it s harder for the Guys to get a reaction.  If you re wanting to have some fun  it can be a GREAT time!  It s the perfect place for Birthday parties - especially if you want to embarrass a friend.  The guys will bring them up to the pianos and perform a little ditty.  For being a good sport  you get the coveted Sing Sing bumper sticker.  Now who wouldn t want that?\n\nDueling Pianos and brews... time to Shut Up & Sing Sing! 
n,Mediocre service. COLD food! Our food waited so long the lettuce & pickles wilted. Bland food. Crazy overpriced. Long waits in the arcade. 1 beer per hour maximum.  Avoid at all costs. Fair manager. 
n,Ok! Let me tell you about my bad experience first. I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party - which  side note  is a great idea!\n\nIt was around midnight and the bar wasn t really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. Kind of counter productive if you ask me. \n\nI stood there for about 5 minutes  which for a busy bar is fine but when I am the only one with my card out then  it just seems a little ridiculous. I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn t ask if i need anything. I finally said   Are you working?  and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.\n\nIn between that time  the other bartender brought food over and set it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B. \n\nI was just really turned off from that experience. \n\nThe good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. This place holds some really good memories for me. \n\nIt s a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards I held for it. 
n,I used to love D&B when it first opened in the Waterfront  but it has gone down hill over the years. The games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality. It takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil! The atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people! Now  it is run down and many of the games are app related games (Fruit Ninja) and 3D Experience rides. With such  games   you can t even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens! Last time I went  back in the winter  many of the games were broken  which made for a negative player experience. I would go to D&B to play some games again in the future  but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets. 
y,Like any Barnes & Noble  it has a nice comfy cafe  and a large selection of books.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  They stock a decent selection  and the prices are pretty reasonable.  Obviously it s hard for them to compete with Amazon.  However since all the small shop bookstores are gone  it s nice to walk into one every once in a while. 
n,Meh  I ve experienced better is an understatement.\n\nFriday s is like the  fine dining chain  for every yinzer in Pittsburgh...\n\n1.  When we were seated  it was quick which was a surprise.  Somehow this restaurant gets packed and I never understand why.  I was happy about that.\n2.  I ordered one of their  skinny margaritas   blackberry to be exact.  It was a nice size  however  at $6.00/pop  that was half of my food bill.\n3.  The waitress started off attentive  but after our food came out she was gone.  I ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard.  Loaded mashed potato on the side because I wanted heartburn ha!\n4.  Food came.  My burger had lettuce on it only.  Waitress was supposed to go and get our next round of drinks.  I had to wait to ask for my pickle.\n5.  The loaded potatoes were more like rubber than potatoes and not what I was expecting.  Disappointment.\n6.  The waitress then went into oblivion and only returned with our check.  \n\nNever again will I eat at Friday s.  I will  however  go should a happy hour arise... 
y,Unos has been around for ever  & I feel like this restaurant chain peak in popularity in the 80 s. Honestly the decor inside still kind of looks 80s to me even though its nice with sleek booth and exposed brick.\n\nIf you haven t died and he recently I ordered you to come back and have a meal here again because honestly the food is really quite good!\n\nThey have the best chicken salad wrap ever! I love that rap so much I want agreed to walk the south side River Trail from where the Steelers practice all the way to the damn waterfront just because I knew that I could convince my boyfriend to go to Unos with me for lunch.  Full disclosure:  I made him call is a cab and we took a taxi back to the parking lot after lunch.\n\nListen... The food and pizza and service are very good  surprisingly so! I don t know why this place is not busier but next time you re down at the Waterfront please do consider dining here! 
n,Stars are for the food only.    2.5 rating\n\nGot there at 8pm on Saturday night  they told us it was an hour wait which was expected  but it only took 30minutes to be seated so that was a bonus.  Started off with the lettuce wraps and i used to be a fan of these but they just seem to bore me now(FYI-love the lettuce wraps at the cheesecake factory).  I had the Singapore rice noodles.  This was so so as i thought immediately that lu lu noodles and asian cafe are better.  The fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw.   Some good notes were the Dynamite shrimp  plump  juicy  tangy with a small kick.    Sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick. \n\nThe service was annoying.   We were there less than 45 minutes and it seemed like our waiter was in a rush to get us out of there.   Constantly asking if he could remove my plate.  I had to sternly say at one point that I will let you know when i am finished.  I found it rude especially since  there wasn t even a line at this point.  \n\nI think we will travel elsewhere following a movie.  The result never quite met the anticipation. 
n,Our last few visits have left something to desire  One of the things I always notice is the demeanor of an establishments employees. These people look miserable  no one smiles or greets you appropriately  it s more like get in  get out  turn the tables \n\nThe food has remained consistently good... when we can order it. the last time JB and I came for a quick dinner  the place was not busy yet we were passed by 6 frowning waitstaff without getting drinks... for 15 minutes we were left suiting at our table with our menus closed and sitting on the edge of the table (HINT  HINT) so we left and most likely will not be returning. 
y,Good quality pork fried dumpling and mongo beef.  Bar service was fast and Efficent.   Good value.  Not a 5 cause dragon eye tea was cold first time around and beef had minor amount of fat.   Fortune was even Postive! 
n,Very bad purchase experience. I bought a shirt with a hole covered in the rolled up sleeves  but they denied my request to return it. I am so angery at this and will never shop their chothes anymore. 
n,When I think BBB... I think the days of simply bringing your bike in for a quick and relatively inexpensive tune-up and a few fixes are long gone.    \n\nThis review is more for the repair end of BBB. In their defense BBB does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike (ie Colnago) that you just don t find anywhere else in Pittsburgh. \n\nAt BBB I was charged $250 for a tune up and a few other things. Granted this included installing a sew up tire (which I can understand would cost approx $50)  Swapping out a left side (big ring) shifter on my down tube (this should have cost approx. $20 at most) and installing new bar tape (cost of tape $20 and $20 to install?).. SO WHAT S WITH $140 FOR A TUNE UP? Well the story goes like this:\n\nI bring the bike into BBB prior to the nice weather hitting Pittsburgh in hopes of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my OCLV TREK 5900 ready for the season. Turns out I don t hear from these guys. A week goes by ...two weeks...I think that s ok I have two or three other bike I can turn to for a ride. Then I wind up going out of town for a week thinking for sure I ll get a call from them re: my bike is ready to roll...but no dice. So I call. Turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was re-installing the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out (is that my fault?). He says  Should be ready in a few days . So I come in a few days later to this mammoth bill. I ask if I am paying for the labor of taping out the screw? I don t think I ever got a straight answer? I look at the bill and can t see a good breakdown of the charges. Normally I would  duke it over  a bill like this but I figured...I had somewhere I to be 10 minutes ago and at least I finally have my bike. I would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over (overhauled). But it wasn t.  Well BBB I ll give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great (nice wrap). Plus I ll toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles. Maybe I would have rated BBB higher if I was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair? 
n,My orders have come out bad pretty much every time I have ordered from here. The chicken nuggets come out under par. I m lucky if the fries come out right. My last experience is the last straw. I recently posted a photo of my Chicken Ranch Club. That has no chicken. This is ridiculous. I am done going to this Mcd s. 
n,Wow. What a shame. My family just moved to the area and have been sampling the local cuisine. We are a very large family and love foods of all kind. We ve eaten Chinese food from a hundred different places in a dozen different cities. Hands down  this was the worst we ve ever had. Cold  tough  congealed  and tasteless - that s the only way to describe it. I ll never order from here again. Quite frankly  the fact that I took time away from my kids to type this out should tell you how awful it was. My complaints fell on deaf ears. I guess they were shocked that someone thought that they were serving low grade dog food. I understand that sometimes restaurants crank out bad food. It happens. But when it does  you bend over backwards to make it right. Not at this place. I was told that he would have to speak with the owner in order to help me. I guess that s how they deflect complaints - blame it on the owners that aren t there and make the customer for away angry.  Too bad. Because we will be visiting a competitor in the future. This family of 7 won t be visiting China Sea ever again. Oh  and by the way  why can t I give this place zero stars? 
y,I fell in love with this place as soon as we pulled up and saw the lights strung up and  oldies coming from the speakers! \n\nI tried the banana cream pie hard ice cream  their scoops are very generous!! \n\nMy bf got the peach cobbler hard ice cream and that was to die for! We got 4 servings of ice cream for $10  which nowadays is a steal IMO! :) \n\nI ll definitely be heading back with my coworkers this week! 
y,This is by far  the BEST soft serve ice cream place in southwestern PA. The  flavor of the week  is always interesting-and tasty! Though  I am somewhat disappointed that they ve switched to a lower grade ice milk  for their vanilla and chocolate offerings. I don t know if this is a matter of cutting corners  or if the better stuff simply isn t available any longer. Either way  this place is still leaps and bounds ahead of DQ  Tastee Freeze  etc. It s definitely worth the trip. It s mostly street parking  though they do have about 3-4 parking spaces off to the side. Serving sizes are huge! The small cone here  is the same size as a DQ large. And the large is SO big  they can t fit it through the window-they hand it out the side door.\n\nIf you want a real  Kodak moment -order a large cone for the kids  and keep the camera  and wet wipes handy! 
y,This is my go-to distributer. They have a great selection and lots of hard to find brews. I haven t noticed that it s any more expensive than going elsewhere but honestly if I don t buy here then I m buying six packs which as we all know are a huuugggge rip off. So any time I have a case of something I love I feel like I m getting a bargain. The cold selection does suck so I try to plan ahead and have what I need already cold. Staff here are all very helpful- and will have recommendations if you ask. 
y,Love this beer distributor.  They always have what I m looking for. The workers are extremely nice and always willing to help. Best one I ve seen by far. 
n,Went here with a gift card from the restaurant week photo competition. \n\nWe were one of two tables there and a bunch of staff showing up during the meal. \n\nOur waitress was good  but that couldn t save the food.\n\nThe meal started out with some what I guess used to be foccacia.  I say used to be because it no longer represented anything other than long pieces of brick or bark very stale and tasteless.\n\nWe ordered the vegetable board which was probably the best thing we ordered with light and bright vegetables perfectly cooked and paired with two delicious sauces. \n\nThen we ordered the octopus which was fine  but very cold and the octopus had little to no flavor  being overwhelmed by the citrus in the dish. \n\nThe tuscan wings were ok  but they were really ordered for my husband who seemed to enjoy them. \n\nFinally the diver scallops.  This dish was indeible.  The scallops were very overcooked and the pea puree was so minty I was unable to eat it. We sent it back and they did take off half of the price (weren t expecting anything just didn t want to eat it). \n\nAfter that we decided against dessert and left.  I probably will not return. 
n,I went there today! The cut was terrible! I have an awful experience. They lady that cut my hair was nice but she wanted to leave early so she made a disaster in my head! 
y,As a chinese american college student from NYC who got stuck in Pittsburgh with its useless public transportation (circa 1998)  I desperately missed home-style Chinese food for the better part of my first two years here. Things turned around for me once I got a car (or made friends with cars)  but I was seriously hurting for a while.\n\nTasty was one of the places we found. Back in the day  it was owned and ran by a typical restaurant-owning Chinese family. They had the works - pushy lao ban niang (boss lady)  chef slash dad  and  during school off-hours  junior high school daughter manning the cashier. If they were in NYC  they d only be missing an ami.... a bus boy. The food was pretty good  and if you order in Chinese  the lao ban niang hooked you up with extras because  your parents teach you good to talk Chineees . \n\nI m pretty sure Tasty is under new ownership now. The food isn t as good as it was  but the restaurant still gives off the home-style look and feel. It s a small restaurant with enough seating for about 25-30 patrons. Cheap tables  cheap seats; after all  restaurant extras are just a waste of money. The customers should come back for the food  this *is* a restaurant.\n\nThe new waitress is not friendly  but she gets the job done. The food is still good - so if you re craving a home cooked meal  you ll be somewhat satisfied here. Don t expect grandma s cooking  though. Order the vegetables  the mapo tofu is good  beef/chicken chow fun  etc. They have a lot of other staple items on the menu too. Don t get the salted pork chops - save that craving for Orient Kitchen. Try things  and share your thoughts.\n\nTasty - it s more than your neighborhood take out joint.\n\n- written by a former junior high school daughter cashier 
y,This shelter is fantastic and has generally very good  friendly people on staff.  The cats and dogs appear to be treated at least as well as one might expect.\n\nWhen I adopted one of my cats at this establishment  I had to return the next day to have her spayed.  They did it for free  which was great  but the reason they don t get five stars is that the desk clerk completely forgot about my cat and me  and she left us waiting as she chatted on her cell phone with a friend: she only remembered about us as she was walking out for a smoke and saw us sitting in the lobby. 
n,Our cat recently came down with some health issues that we could not afford to address. He was in pain and we decided the humane thing was to put him to sleep. We went to the ARL and asked the receptionist there if we had any other options available to us.  Well basically the only thing you can do is sign him over for euthanasia  she said in the most uncaring  apathetic voice possible. We were heartbroken of course.  Go wait by that door and someone will meet you.  After a few minutes another woman came out and took the carrier.  I ll bring your carrier back out in a minute.  We said no  that s okay  keep the carrier. She said okay and took our cat to the back. And that was it. No kind words  no sympathetic gestures  no  Would you like a moment before I take him?  No  I m sorry.  Nothing. For us this was one of the worst days of our lives but nobody at the ARL seemed to care  or at least have been trained to pretend to care  one bit. \n\nThey get a couple stars for offering a necessary service. But other than that  this place will only be associated with making a terrible day that much worse with their lack of caring or empathy. 
y,Yes! Awesome soy cap  scone  and atmosphere. Nice place to hang out & read  and free WiFi with no login procedure. 
n,The people who work here are very rude. I have gone back a few times thinking it may have just been the person working that day was just a rude person  but no it happen every time. I am not a young hip person and felt very out of place there. It is like you are walking into someone s house and bothering them. The people working behind the counter act like you are interfering with there conversation. Plus it is very dirty. Perhaps the people working there should try cleaning the place instead of talking to each other. I will not go back again. 
n,I ve been here quite a few times  and I always try to like it cause theres a lack of good sports bars near Pitt. They have a ton of nice HDTVs.\n\nEverytime I go  there is always a weird taste to one (or more) of the beers that I get. I was just there for the Pitt/Oakland game and got a Redhook. I drink this beer regularly  and something was wrong with the beer. Its definitely hard to describe  but something is always off (others in my party notice it too).\n\nThe food is hit or miss. I got the French onion soup last time. It was good. Nothing ground breaking  but solid soup. I ve had the pork nachos and they were blah. 
n,The location is convenient but I was not a fan of the food. I had shrimp and Chinese veggies and crab Rangoon. They cut the veggies way too big and the sauce was bland. I won t go back for food but the crab Rangoon was ok. They didn t give any sauce. You have to ask for it. That sucks. 
y,I cannot sing Tim Walter s praises loud enough.\n\nI have taken my car to him for about 5 years  and I always leave with a new experience attesting to his awesomeness. If you think you might have something wrong with your car that you re not sure what it is  you can just stop by  and he ll usually take a break from what he s working on to get in your car with you and drive for a little bit and then give you his opinion. Then  when he diagnoses your car  he ll explain it to you like you re not an idiot  and he ll make sure you understand what s going on. He s incredibly honest and cares about his customers. For instance  once I had a tire that needed to be replaced but he didn t have it in stock. He told me how much it would cost to have the tire ordered and how long it would take to come in  then he called another shop to see if they had it and asked how much they were charging for it  and he sent me there because it would be cheaper and faster for me than having him order it. The price difference was like ten bucks  so I had him do it because it wasn t an emergency and I d rather give him my business. He s awesome. 
y,The first time I came here  I waited in line for 20 minutes.  When it was my turn  I realized I left my wallet in the car.  It hurt so bad  I didn t come back for a year.\n\nI can walk to this place from my house- which is dangerous because those biscuits are just OH SO DREAMY.  I can t describe them.  Just get some.\n\nDo I feel guilty about noshing on fabulous Strawberry Napoleons and Jewish Pizza (kind of like a modified  yet TOTALLY delicious fruitcake bar) at 10:15am?  Hecks  naw... But they do have quiche and some other breakfast-y items for those who prefer a more traditional approach to your stomach s opening ceremony.\n\nJust go early :)  They open at 10 on Saturdays.  And bring cash...it s easier that way. 
y,I m a creature of habit--I ve been getting a savory and sweet item each time I m around the neighborhood. White lily cake is divine! Quiches always tasty. Macarons are alittle too sweet. I wish the cake slices weren t $4/pop. Otherwise  would be a regular here. 
n,I don t know  maybe I m not clear on the concept of Whole Foods.  Don t get me wrong  there s nothing really wrong with shopping at Whole Foods.  Whole Foods does have wonderful merchandise  but...\n\nI have found that I can buy a lot of the same organic things and environmentally safe cleaners at Giant Eagle for less.\n\nThier wine and beer selection  supposedly quite remarkable in other states  well remember  this is Pennsylvania.  You can t buy those things at the grocery store.  \n\nI can get just as good quality meat and produce in the Strip District.  Sometimes  even better quality.\n\nI guess the benefit of Whole Foods  is that you can find a lot under one roof and don t have to spend a lot of time and gas going to different stores.  I m not slamming Whole Foods at all  but I actually like Trader Joe s better. 
y,We decided to give brunch a try for our first visit to Casbah.  We were surprised  by the huge tent covering the  outdoor  dining area.  We opted for an inside table  the interior is somewhat small the tables are close together.  For brunch  you are served your choice of drink  appetizer and entree.  \n\nFor our drinks  BJ had a Bloody Mary and I had a Bellini.  We were served a basket of yummie bread and mini muffins.  For appetizers  we got a Three Sisters Farms mesclun greens and smoked salmon and truffled potato cake.  Very good.  For entrees we selected a jumbo lump crab & tomato omelet and the NY strip steak.  Very relaxing and tasty meal. 
y,When scoping around online for a good NYE dinner destination for my husband and me  Casbah s prix fixe menu really jumped off the page! Since the Big Burrito group is so popular  I was happy to get reservations  especially since a lot of times were already booked.\n\nThe hubby and I arrived a few minutes early for dinner. I had planned additional time to park and was delightfully reminded that Big Burrito restaurants have free valet parking -- so great  especially with slushy snow on the ground! Even though we were a few minutes early  the hostess took our coats and seated us immediately.  \n\nService was extremely attentive from start to finish. Waters were re-filled quickly. Bread was brought to the table almost immediately and we were offered another basket as soon as we finished the first. The bread came with a delicious spread - was it goat cheese? - that I just couldn t stop eating. Silverware whisked away with each course was promptly replaced.\n\nWe ordered both the land and sea courses to share so we could try the entire NYE prix fixe menu. None of the eight dishes disappointed! The first courses were Sea Scallops & Octopus and Duck Confit. The sea scallop was perfectly cooked  the octopus - thought not my cup of tea! - was also well cooked  and the balsamic flavor in the dish was very tasty. I absolutely loved the duck confit dish. It was served with mustard greens and fruit with a to-die-for dressing - a delicious combination!\n\nThe second courses were Potato Gnocchi and Mushroom Tortelloni. The gnocchi was served with lobster  which was a unique but nice paring. Though a strongly flavored dish  the tortelloni was delicious  and I enjoyed another unique paring  tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib.\n\nLake Ontario Walleye and Roasted Veal Strip Loin were the third courses. Both were cooked to perfection. The walleye s skin was perfectly crispy  and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender. However  a component of each dish was disappointing -- a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal. I really can t hold this against Casbah though. I m just not a fan of mustard!\n\nFinally  the desserts was fantastic! The Chocolate Ganache Tart was the ending of the sea courses. The chocolate was strong  even a little bitter  and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote. I grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite  and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish. A Caramel Macaroon completed the land courses. The macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce.\n\nOur experience at Casbah was spectacular! Based on this experience  I debated giving the restaurant five stars... but decided to wait until I returned a second time. And I can t wait to return! 
n,Overpriced  salty and overrated!!! Why this place is so popular I will never understand. 
y,Every time I have been to Casbah for lunch  brunch  or dinner  the food has been great and the service has been impeccable.  Sure  I ve had more exceptionally delicious and unique meals in Pittsburgh  but Casbah has Consistent Awesomeness down pat.  Just get a reservation ahead of time.  Also  the desserts are mandatory!  \n\nThe duck confit gnocchi is smashing-- it s a nice balance of slightly sweet and very savory--and my favorite is probably the Casbah Double-Cut Pork Chop: super-yum comfort food.  The short rib ravioli is some pot-roasty Goodness  and the long island duck is another great choice.  \n\nA nice surprise here are the great happy hour specials at the bar.  Try the Boyd & Blair cocktail and the sangria. 
y,My girlfriend and I went to Casbah for the first time recently and we both enjoyed our experience.\n\nThe atmosphere is dressy  but the restaurant isn t so formal that it feels stuffy or uncomfortable  which is a welcome change compared to most classy restaurants.  The environment was relaxed  and it was easy to have a quiet conversation throughout the meal.  As for the meal itself  we had a reservation and were promptly seated when we showed up.\n\nOur waiter was courteous and provided good  fast service without being overbearing or constantly hovering  which was quite nice.  For an appetizer  we ordered the cheese tray which was tasty as well as fun and unique.\n\nFollowing the cheese tray  I dined on the cioppino while my girlfriend had the casereccia.  Both dishes were tasty and our seafood was skillfully cooked  particularly the sea bass in my dish which was delicious.\n\nI d recommend this restaurant for anyone looking to celebrate an occasion or have some good  out of the ordinary food. 
y,I am not a vegan and went there to meet friends and enjoy the atmosphere. I must say the hipster  tude of the place was intimidating at first  but it s super friendly and retro-feeling.  Servers were fairly friendly.  We had some great lattes and chai teas and chatted for a long time without being bothered.  Didn t try the food  but there were lots of vegeterian and vegan options. 
y,This Valentines Day I ordered a pizza for my boyfriend and asked that they make a heart on it out of green peppers. The pizza was great  the heart was perfect  and he loved it! 
n,It seems like every other time I take my pets to Point Breeze there is an unnecessary frustration.   From being berating for using their online prescription program to being misquoted prices substantially to poor customer service I just keep hoping each time will be better.  Although I know they love animals I suspect they love money more.  Dr. Caroline. Simard is an excellent vet  but my last two visits have been pushed to other vets whose bedside manner is atrocious.   I m a 40 year-old  who has been taking my pets to vets since childhood and I don t understand why each visit leaves a sour taste in my mouth. 
n,Refused to take my cat  which had passed away  for cremation cause I had not been to the clinic previously. IMHO that s ridiculous. I will not recommended anyone to ever come here. 
n,My partner and I were visiting my family in Pittsburgh we live in San Diego. my partner was born and raised in Portugal. My mom heard about this resaurant and was excited to take my partner and I to a Portuguese restaurant in Pittsburgh. We went  looked at the menu and did not find anything Portuguese on the menu. Why does this restaurant promote itself as Portuguese  fly the Portuguese flag and not have ANY Portuguese dishes. We left. 
y,What a gem of a place in Shadyside.  It s places like this that makes me miss living there.  Food was outstanding!  Because it was our first time  we wanted to do a little bit of this and that.  2 appetizers  Becky s salad and the special of the eve:  smoked salmon on crostini with creme fresh  a clam dish  forgot name  with the best tomatoe-white wine  I could have drunk from the bowl  broth; Becky s salad (the lemon dressing was out of this world delicious--again  could have drunk it  good).  I m usually not fan of walnut in my salad  but the crumbled goat cheese made me forget about my dislike of it  that I ate it happily.  Good pairing.  The special of the night  we opted for sharing the lamb shank with reduced red wine sauce and simple veggies.  Small veggie selection by american standards--half russet potato  slither of zucchini  and a stem of green onion  but the star afterall was the lamb  and it was meduim perfect  just as I ordered!  \n Would you care for some dessert?   Ramon  our waiter (he was fabulous!) asked.  And so round 3 begins.  Coffee  a chocolate mousse with whip cream  beauty and...  their version of creme brulee.  I thought it had a hint of peanut butter  but not sure.  Regardless it was  so  so divine.\nThis place was busy but we did not feel rushed  unlike most places.  The service was great  the atmoshphere quaint; it s definitely a neighbourhood cafe-- alot of repeat clientele  from what I gathered.  We shall return.\nFinally  on an end note. Cafe Zinho is BYOB  so bring your favourite bottle or magnum of vino.  And they only take cash or personal check  but they do have an ATM. 
n,And so....the search for a new hair salon continues. Sigh. Don t get me wrong  the cut was a good cut. The salon itself was clean and stylish. The owner  welcoming and friendly. \n\nNow what went wrong. The cut was good  but it certainly wasn t what I expected from a salon with the reputation of Izzazu. I wasn t bowled over by my stylist s professionalism either. Don t diss my previous stylist....she rocked....you don t do yourself any favors by knocking someone else.  (And come on  I was WAAAYYYY overdue for a cut since I ve been driving to Cleveland for a style.)  That being said  for $55 (and saving big bucks on gas  tolls  lunch and shopping) the cut was still a deal. But  when I started to sign the charge slip  it said $65  not $55.  But   I said   the website said it was $55 for a Master stylist.   Oh   the chick at the counter said   that s for Men s cuts.  Silly me. \n\nSo when I got back to the office  I went online and checked. Nope  it said $55 for a Master Stylist WOMEN s haircut. Hmmmmm. So I called. The chick at the counter now said   Oh  our stylist s charge whatever they feel the cut SHOULD be.  What?????? So I quoted the prices to her from the Izzazu website. She changed her tune again.  Oh  well.....I ll refund you $10 if you give me your credit card number.  Didn t she have my slip with the card number?  Sorry  I don t give my credit card number over the phone.   Or I can send you a gift certificate.   Nope   I said through clenched teeth   I won t be coming back. \n\nIt wasn t the cut. It was the bait and switch. I d gladly have paid it had they been up front and above-board ahead of time. As Judge Judy says   Don t pee on my leg and tell me it s raining.  \n\nThe search goes on. Or I ll be back in Cleveland in the spring for the next cut!\n\nP. S.  One amusing side note:  I checked in at Izzazu when I arrived.  Turns out  I m the Duchess!  The Duchess is displeased. 
y,Page s is a Pittsburgh icon. The ice cream is good  the selection is vast  and the price is right. They have so many different things to try  it s nearly impossible to choose. I m a big fan of the cookie sundae  brownie sundae  and cinnamon roll sundae. The options at this place are pretty much endless. But sometimes a regular soft serve sugar cone is the way to go. It s better than Dairy Queen  AND you support a local business by going here. What more could you ask for. \n\nI don t know if I would say that Page s has particularly superior soft serve  but it s the experience and variety that makes this a four star place. I do think the ice cream is better than somewhere like Dairy Queen  but not by much. What makes Page s special is wide variety of options and soft serve flavors. It s also the nostalgia that goes along with it. It s a business that hasn t changed much in it s lifetime  and that s what most people like about it. You can count on Page s to be there every March-October. They re going to offer the same treats you loved as a kid for your whole lifetime.  It represents the change of the seasons and brings back memories for people. It means a lot more to people than just a summertime ice cream stop. \n\nFor those who have never been there  there is no interior so you ll have to eat in your car or standing outside. I prefer to open the back of my SUV  sit there and enjoy the night while I eat my ice cream. The parking lot is hectic and downright scary sometimes. I typically avoid this place on busy nights just for that reason. \n\nBeware  they only accept cash. But there is an ATM on site! 
n,The first time I went here was with a group - we had reserved the entire restaurant for a retirement party.   I had a horrible experience.  Vowed never to go back!  At that time  I even had a terrible interaction with the owner.\n\nThis time I was invited with a couple of girlfriends because they love it. Decided to try again since it was more about the  get together  than the food/location.\n\nThis time  overpriced food and bad service.  Overall  it was not anything out of the ordinary and not worth the price.   I had the veal speciality.   Large portion  but ok.  Staff was not very attentive for the small amount of customers present.\n\nI am a Pittsburgh native.  This is a bad neighborhood. \n\nI am NOT interested in ever going back! 
n,Our experience not so great.  We have mortgage as well as basic free checking and savings with Dollar in Squirrel Hill.  Mortgage application process was brutal.  Starting with the advertised rate of 2.85% being suddenly not available when we decided to lock it in; got 3.01%.  Automatic deduction of mortgage payment was required to secure this rate and it came out of the required Dollar checking account on the first business day of the month.  Free checking is free ... until.  Beware of Funds Availability policy.  We deposit a check monthly at the end of the month.  In August  the end of the month was a weekend and Labor Day was on September 1.  So our check did not get deposited until 9/2.  Mortgage payment hit on 9/2. It was paid  but we were charged $36 insufficient funds due solely to Funds Availability Policy.  After doing this first  Dollar then merrily hits us with two more $36 charges on smaller checks that would have cleared had they been processed before the mortgage payment.  Had we NOT been required to submit to automatic deduction of mortgage  according to our monthly statement  we had at least 10 days grace to make the payment  so Dollar s requirements and policies trapped us into this situation.  Moreover  there was over $3000 in the associated savings account that was ignored.  I called to protest  and one of the $36 fees was waived.  Then I was offered the  deal  of overdraft protection from the savings account for an annual fee plus a $10 transaction fee should this situation ever arise again.  Needless to say  I declined this deal and transferred the savings to the checking account where it sits until I find another bank and then fire Dollar. 
n,I recently bought my first motorcycle (a 2001 KTM Duke II) and found Bohn s when searching online for KTM dealers. I went in with the intention of buying a jacket  helmet and gloves. Their store is pretty nice inside  and they have a good selection of gear (mostly dirt-oriented though). \n\nI wasn t quite sure what I wanted  so I asked a lady for some assistance in picking out a helmet. She was helpful  and recommended a jacket that would be usable in different types of weather. However  a friend who was with me said he had a different type of jacket (which they also sold)  and she commented that the  hated  that jacket and that the liner was  nothing more than a glorified garbage bag.  Ok...\n\nWe also talked to a guy at the register about a  96 KTM 300 MXC that my friend just bought  and asked a simple question about a clutch cable. The guy seemed totally disinterested and clueless  and I m not really sure if he even knew what a clutch was. He ended the conversation by saying that my friend should just throw his bike away because it was so old. What!?\n\nEven after that  I still bought a jacket from them and ordered a helmet I liked that they had assured me would be in later that week. I then got a call from them a few days later saying that the helmet was no longer available  but that I could pick another style. I then just ordered the helmet online and went back the next day to get a refund.\n\nI wanted to like this place  but between the thinly-veiled insults and seemingly clueless repair staff  I don t think I ll ever return. Their prices and selection are pretty decent  so if you are in the area and know what you want  it might be OK to stop by and pick something up. If you have any alternative  though  I would avoid this place. 
y,Fun bar  and instead of typical bar food they lean towards Greek dishes. The blue grass jam on Wednesdays is a lot of fun and not too loud to still enjoy a conversation. Decent beer prices  pretty good selection. 
n,Despite living in PIttsburgh for most of my life  I ve somehow managed to never eat at Max s Allegheny Tavern until recently.  \n\nMy initial impression of the restaurant was positive - the place had an old neighborhood feel to it  a small crowd was drinking at the end of the antique hardwood bar  and the German murals on the walls made me crave an icy-cold German lager with a stout head of foam.  I thought about how well German potato salad would taste with that beer.  So I grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer.\n\nAnd I waited...and waited...and waited some more - for over 15 minutes before someone came around to take the order.  Actually that isn t quite accurate.  Two employees came around - one to the end of the bar  and one behind the bar directly opposite me.  Both of them stared at me.  Neither one greeted me or asked me what I would have like to order.  I stared back  incredulously  and even made a  what s going on here  palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.\n\nFinally a third employee came around the bar and took my order.  Great  I thought to myself  finally that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who serves imported German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max s does.  The beer was devoid of its head  likely the result of a bad beer pour and/or a less than perfectly clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants  in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.\n\nMy first impression of the menu can be summed as follows:  Uh-oh .  The menu is huge with a number of  slow-food  stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items  including more than a few labor-intensive dishes  freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn t even half-full?  Answer: They can t.  The food isn t fresh.\n\nI ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast  slightly pounded and seasoned  well-coated in fresh bread crumbs  and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside  Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.  \n\nSadly  Max s Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin  had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed  and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn t pan fried either.  The breaded  frozen  puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn t happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.\n\nMy sides  German potato salad and braised red cabbage  were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The  bacon  in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed  possibly faux   meat .  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled  pre-sliced  vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey  sickly sweet  mess.  I didn t have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn t taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  \n\nMax s Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as   The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service .\n\nThat s total bullshit.  It s awful - both for service and fare.\n\nIf you want good  authentic  German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious)  join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.  \n\nI ll never return. 
y,First time customer today.  It is truly a dive but the sandwiches are great.  Large portions  fresh bread and cheap... 
y,I went to a Bob Marley laser show as a  favor  for my husband...  the lasers were really cool.  I would not recommend them if you are prone to migraines  or have a neuro disorder  such as seizures.\nI think if the music was more my taste  it would have been awesome. 
y,Love this place! I was visiting Pittsburgh from Houston and we decided to finish off our visit with this museum - or should I say museums. Coming from Houston where we have some pretty good museums  this was a pleasant surprise - really cheap considering you get both Art and Natural History.\nThe dinosaur exhibit was so interesting and educational.  The gem and mineral exhibit was huge. And the art museum had a surprisingly awesome collection - I was thrilled to see a couple Van Goghs  Monets  Cezannes  etc.\nThe only exhibit I didn t much care for was the temporary art exhbit - some contemporary craziness that involved body parts dangling from the ceiling.. at least it gave us something to talk about.\nAll in all I did not spend nearly as much time here as I could have and would have liked. I highly recommend this for anyone visiting Pittsburgh. 
y,Been there three times and each time it got better.  Most recent dinner was with a party of 14.  A large crowd for a smal place but they made it work.  Everyone was extremely pleased with their meal.  The lobster ravioli & salmon specials were top notch.  The service was even better than the food if that is possible.  Best restaurant in the burgh & it s BYOB to boot.  Make sure you have reservations. 
n,The store reeks of rotting fish  the security guards watch you like a hawk and the food selection is the worse I ve seen in any Giant Eagle in the city.\n\nOne plus if you must shop here there are plenty of jitney drivers waiting for you to come out to offer you a ride.  That can be a big help if you are like me and don t have a car.  Need a car  haha some things about living in the hood just never change. \n\nWith this being the closet G E to Downtown and PNC Park and Heinz field I would think they would renovate but it s been years and still no change. 
n,I really wasn t thrilled with our meal here. The service was fine  although a bit slow for a not-so-busy Wednesday night. We started with the breaded zucchini  which was about 90% breading  10% zucchini. The breading was much too heavy and you could barely taste the vegetable.\n\nI had the parmesan crusted chicken with pasta  which seemed to be coated in the same breading they used on the zucchini  still too heavy and altogether flavorless. The chicken was cooked perfectly though  it just needed some spices and salt and pepper for goodness sake. The pasta was cooked well and the sauce was fine though. My husband was not thrilled with his pasta primavera  which was  strangely enough  very spicy (though the server did warn us about this beforehand  to her credit) and again  not much flavor and many of the veggies not cooked thoroughly. 
y,Seattle may have just won the 2014 Super Bowl  but the Steelers still rock with six rings  Baby!!! Just stating what all Steeler fans know: a Steel Dynasty is still unmatched no matter what team claims the title of current Super Bowl Champs.. Go Steelers!!! 
n,Okay so I tried this place twice before writing a review to give them a fair shot. Unfortunately  the second visit wasn t any better.\n\nI will start with the good. Service is pretty good.\n\nThe place smells of smoke. Why? Because you can smoke in the bar and there is an opening from the bar into the restaurant. This has to be a violation of the no smoking in dining areas in Pittsburgh. Gross. \n\nThe floor (carpeted) is so old that it is sticky and worn down. Walking on it with shoes on disgusted me. The walls have wall paper torn off throughout the place. Please  remodel! At least make me feel like the place is clean. If I feel like it is dirty in the dining hall  I can t imagine it s clean in the kitchen.\n\nNow for the food. I am pretty picky about seafood. It needs to be fresh and cooked correctly. Don t get the Salmon or Tuna Steak. Tuna and Salmon should be easy to get right if you just season and cook it properly. Both tasted very fishy to me. Salmon that tastes overly fishy  to me  screams  this fish is not fresh . Mashed potatoes are not made from real potatoes. Don t get them unless you are looking to eat boxed potatoes. I get it  you wanna have a mom and pop shop. But to do that you need to have great food.\n\nOverall  I just don t think this place is good  and don t want to go back. 
y,Review #200\n\nI got hooked on this bakery while living in Brighton Heights.  Now  when I drive past  I HAVE to stop.  I think this one is so much better than the sister store in West View.  I don t know why; I just like it better.\n\nThe sweetest ladies run this local bakery  and they always serve with a smile.  It s usually pretty fast too!  And they re CHEAP.  Doughnuts and giant muffins for $.65.  Cookies of all shapes and sizes are delicious and cheap as well.  It makes me so happy.  Some favorites:\n\nAll of the doughnuts:  Raised or cake  cream or jelly  chocolate or vanilla  they re ALL SO GOOD.  I wish I could stop and say no.  But I just can t.  The selection here doesn t go too fast.  I can usually still get one around lunch time  but if you want options  go early.\n\nLemon Poppyseed Muffin:  They run out quick  but they re so yummy!  It usually triumphs over the doughnuts.\n\nThumbprint cookies:  Maybe I just love the cookie  but I really like them here too!\n\nIs the cliental a little special sometimes?  You bet.  Are the hours old fashioned early to open and early to close?  Yup.  But I just view it as absence makes the heart grow fonder.... :) 
n,This was my second visit and alas  my last. \n\nOur first visit was at lunch and it was just OK. We weren t blown away nor were we impressed. But I will always opt to support a local Mom & Pop shop if all things are equal. This last visit was the pits.\n\nIt was 5:30pm on a Saturday night. We were one of two tables. This is usually an indication of something fishy (excuse the pun.) Appetizer was edamame. It was overcooked and left uneaten. I am not the adventurous sushi order-er; I had California rolls and spicy tuna. The tuna rolls were mostly spicy sauce then fish  very mayonnaise-y and unsatisfying. As for my CA rolls  the avocado was all brown! Not just the parts on the top (because I checked!) all the way through. When I brought it to the staff s attention her response was  Oh  yea. Avocado is like banana. They get brown very easily and we cut that yesterday.  WHAT?!? They did bring me another batch (that was part brown  part green) but it was too late. This was my first sushi restaurant EVER that we left half the rolls on the plate uneaten. Since we were all still hungry  my daughter picked up the table tent listing all the desserts. Yuck! Filthy. Not wiped down in a long while or perhaps ever. When I set it back is when I noticed the wall also needed a good wipe down. Needless to say  we skipped dessert. \n\nOur first visit deserved a 2.5 but this visit was a 1. 
n,BED BUGS!!! Horrible place! DO NOT STAY HERE!! Stayed here for a wedding we attended. Woke up in the middle of the night with bites all over my legs  arms  and back. We flip a pillow over and there it was. BED BUGS. We had to cut our trip short. The man at the front desk apologized and gave us the managers name and number and told us to call back later that morning. We have been calling since 8/10 and have yet to receive a call back. Such disrespect. We risk bringing back bed bugs and spending hundreds on extermination fees and no has the decency to call back. 
y,I had not been to Betos in many many years.  Boy has the place grown up.  Still the same pizza that you will either love or hate.\n\nThe Pizza here has the chesse and topings put on after they cook it so it melts some while you eat it.  Tastes really good.  \n\nI also has the apetizer sampler which was a lot of food for two people.\n\n\nWas not to crowded  but full Saturday at lunch.\n\nHighly recommended. 
y,A different style (love or hate) pizza. A square cut thicker crust with cold shredded cheese on top. It s different enough that it is a good chance of pace to your standard pie. 
y,Great shop! Watched them make their waffle comes right in the shop and they are delish!\n\nTried the salted caramel and was surprised to find little chocolate covered caramels inside! Yum! 
y,I will never forget Campiti s. As a youngster growing up playing on Potomac Avenue and Dormont. My favorite pizza was and still is Campiti s. I have not found an equal in the 18 years I have been in CA. The hoagies were pretty damn good too. 
n,Agree with chaitiyana. This place is pretty bad. The food isn t fresh. They have a Buffet even for dinner. I stayed at Days Inn for 2wks here and was forced to eat here a few times. The mango lassi was good  the naans (when fresh) were good  but mostly it all stunk. 
y,got the buffet pizza was good they also give you free soup to . 
y,I had a positive experience with this shop. I needed something framed at the last minute  and within extremely precise parameters (that weren t easy to abide by)  and they not only got the work done correctly and on time  but at a reasonable price. \n\nThe staff is a little gruff  but not at all unfriendly  and I am happy to have found a local shop that I will return to. 
n,Cons:\n* Very cramped space  aisles are so narrow that you have to carry your case sideways.\n* Only a few items were priced with signs hanging above them.\n* No shopping carts.\n\nPros:\n* Decent selection\n* Chilled section 
y,I lived in Pittsburgh for four years and have never been to D s  but I visited recently and went with some friends. What lured me was the promise of veggie dogs and burgers  and I was not let down. I got two hot dogs--a Chicago and a mac and cheese. Really  really good. My boyfriend ordered the Red Alert dog (his was meat) and his face basically melted off  but he insisted he loved it. Then he said the spices may or may not have traveled to his tear ducts  but to each his own. He had a great time. My two friends also got the mac and cheese veggie dog and loved it. \nThe beer cave is awesome. \nI d love to give D s five stars  but like a couple of people mentioned  the service is lacking. Everyone is friendly  but I had to walk around and find our server so I could pay  and then find him again when he didn t return. It took us a while to get water refills  too. The dining area and the bar are separated  and it seems like the servers congregate in one place and leave the other vacant at any given time. Very nice people though. 
y,Something different here.\n\nFood  schmood  go there and drink the beers from the beer cave.  I don t think you have to wait for the server to open your beer  they ll notice and charge your accordingly.  It s all walk in and self service beer  why don t more places do that?!\n\nMike 
n,It s got it s ups and downs.  It s got a reasonably attractive interior  antique tin ceilings  a broad selection of dozens of beers and a tasty looking menu featuring daily specials.  So why my low score?  D s at the other end of the block puts their beer collection to shame offering 1000 beers   Both times I ve eaten here the wait to be served has been extremely slow (at least 30 minutes and up) the prices are a bit high ($10-$15 for a lunch entree) and most importantly the food is in general heavy and bland.  This is not a terrible place  but with so many delicious spots nearby in regent square like the green mango  map room  d s and the square cafe you should keep on walking.  That said  if you wanted a quiet spot to grab a beer with a friend  you could definitely do worse  but skip the boring food. 
y,Food is delicious and staff is very prompt.  \n\nThe one thing I absolutely love about this restaurant is how clean the bathroom is!!!  I was completely stunned and amazed when I walked in. 
y,I got two pairs of shoes fixed here recently and I was very pleased with the work done and the cost.  It is a great little business to have in the neighborhood! \nMake sure you call and check their hours... Saturdays are probably your best bet. 
y,BEST SUBS EVER.  Seriously.  We saw this on  PA n at with Dave and Dave  and it looks awesome.  We took the drive to Swissvale and got us a  Battleship  and it was literally 3 feet long  just the right amount of veggies and meat and delicious.  It was 2 meals worth of food (for two people).  Even better the next day.  And the best part was that it was under 13 bucks.  \n\nIt s great  fast food.  I can t wait to bring friends there to enjoy their selection of 40s along with a Battleship. 
n,This place is okay. The waiter was horrible and barely checked on us. The food was also not too good. It was very bland and didn t have a lot of taste to it. I will not be coming back. 
n,The worst pulled pork sandwich I have ever had.    Their watermelon mixed drink was very good though.  I won t be returning. 
n,Being born and raised into an all Italian family  I m pretty darn picky about my pastas and gravy (tomato sauce for the unknowing). My great grandmother s sauce was the first I remember  she never opened a can to make her sauces  always using tomatoes she canned herself in mason jars. She simmered her sauces until every seed melted away. My mother s sauce was a bit more thicker  using puree and paste as a base  later adding whole peeled tomatoes  garlic and fresh basil. Her sauce cooks down to a velvety pasta sauce that should be jarred and sold on super market shelves.\n\nSorry on to my review of Olive Garden. seriously? Really? No! I will admit it s good in a fit of really  REALLY needing a pasta fix  or if you want to eat breadstick and salad. But the sauces are overly rich  and I don t mean the tomato sauces. I mean the sauces they put over the pasta with chicken  beef or fish. And  let me be real Italian here  pasta is NEVER the main meal in an Italian supper  Pasta is normally the first course and NEVER served with meat  including MEATBALLS. Thats as American as fortune cookies. after pasta  comes the protein  that includes meatballs  then finally salad.\n\nOkay  I m done being a snooty Italian who looks down upon Olive Garden  I got out all my frustrations on you  my readers. But seriously  if you want good Italian food  hit up a REALLY good neighborhood  family owned Italian restaurant. The service is better  it will be cheaper and it won t go to a big conglomerate who over charges on a plate of pasta  which is one of the cheapest food you can serve. Oh  two stars for a pretty good bowl of Pasta Fazoo (pasta and beans). 
y,Great bagels  sandwiches  soup  and coffee!\nMy favorites are the veg-out bagel sandwich  the bagel dog on onion  and their sour cream potato salad is so good too.\nIf you like all beef hotdogs  you should try the bagel dog. They wrap bagel around the dog. When they heat it up  the juice soaks into that chewy bagel and it is heaven.  Mmm. 
y,There is serious separation anxiety when you have to leave your stylist  with whom you have established a bond  and maybe even spilled serious personal information to. \n\nHaving moved from the south  I had to leave a woman I loved and strike out into all new territory. It was the end of a 2 year relationship  and I wasn t prepared to see just any old body after that. \n\nThen I found Nicolette at MCN. She s amazing and chill and friendly and interesting and and AND she s great at her job. Also  the salon is beautiful and the stylists range in price  so if you are occasionally living from paycheck to paycheck (like me ) you can see Jenn or Kara and get a great cut without having to scrounge through your piggy bank for a little extra.\n\nHowever  if you don t like dogs  be aware that Josie  the bulldog  is frequently around and about. 
n,I booked a hair apt here after reading some of the reviews on Yelp  hoping I d find a place to get my hair cut after moving to Pittsburgh from NJ. Maybe it was just the hairdresser I booked an appointment with  but I did not have a great experience. I m a nurse who works mostly day shifts  and I value sleep over styling my hair in the morning. I tried to articulate that I wanted a hair cut that required minimal styling on my part. The hairdresser immediately shot me down  asking me how I expected to have my hair look nice if I wasn t willing to put work into it. She then berated me for not using styling products-- again  I d rather sleep. \n\nNow  maybe a few people feel differently about their hair  but all I wanted was a cut that allowed for minimal styling on my part. I wasn t asking for some trendy  do that needed 3 different products  a round brush  and a flat iron in order to re-create it. I ended up getting almost the same exact cut I had going in there (just an inch shorter). Oh  and she also told me the cut I had coming in wasn t entirely flattering because of it s blunt ends--- funny  I ended up with the same thing. \n\nThis experience has definitely made me decide never to go back  for $50 I expect a little bit better service and a little bit nicer treatment. Oh  and somewhere that isn t constantly pushing products. 
n,Very sloppy! No attention the polish is all over my fingers so disappointing and aggravating that now I m going to have to pay more money else where to get them redone 
n,Hotel restaurant/bars are usually not known for being the best in town.  So when I had the opportunity to eat and drink at SoHo recently  I can not say I was surprised that I found the cuisine to be on the uninspiring side.  Is it terrible?  No   but you know that better is out there.  \n\nThe blackened chicken wrap was boring.  The flavor was missing and the entire meal was just bland.  Also  white tortillas just do not do it for me.  Why does it seem that Pittsburgh wants to thrive on fatty  flavorless food?\n\nUpon ordering the caesar salad on New Year s Eve  I was told that the restaurant has no non- or low-fat dressing option...at all.  However  I can order a salad with FRENCH FRIES on it.  Seriously?  The salad was fine  by the way  and is a large portion but knowing  that tons of calories had to be consumed just to get a vegetable in me was disappointing.\n\nOn the bright side  the smoked turkey wrap  which comes with havarti cheese and cranberry sauce was ridiculously good.  The turkey was juicy and melded perfectly with the cheese and cranberries.  That I could eat again and it would  fill me up all day.\n\nI also sampled the buffalo pierogies and really just found them to be the Mrs. T s ones with Frank s Hot Sauce on them.  They were good  but uncreative considering the price ($8.99).\n\nThe drinks here are decently priced and pretty good.  Friends I was with sampled a few of the drinks on the interesting cocktail menu and were happy with their choices...they were strong drinks.  When my co-worker and I arrived though one night to dine here  we were not offered cocktail menus so I just stuck with wine until I was no longer in the mood for a cocktail.  \n\nService on New Year s Eve was apathetic.  Granted  the place was packed  but we had  to wait for silverware and had our food and drinks pretty much thrown at us.  Even when it slowed down we were barely paid attention to and were hardly treated with any amount of friendliness even though numerous drinks and food orders were made.\n\nThere are a ton of TVs here  so it is a great spot to watch a game.  Even during busy times  there is a space for you but it will take a while to flag down a server to seat you if you want to sit.  \n\nI think I would stop back here if I find myself at the Springhill Suites again  but I definitely would not go out of my way to dine here.  Can t win  em all  right?  \n\nPro-tip:  You can not access the restaurant from the hotel it is attached to (Springhill Suites) without a key and you can not leave the restaurant to get into the hotel without one.  Want some good people watching?  Sit and watch people try to get from one to the other without realizing you need a key.  Ridiculous.  Since you can access each of these places without a key from other doors  this does not make any sense.  But  it is what it is so do not forget your key! 
n,DIDN T EAT HERE...this review not about the food.  We went on Friday night around 8pm  there seemed to be about 25% occupancy.  The hostess asked us if we had a reservation  we didn t   and she told us that they were somewhat behind and that we would have to wait 20-30 minutes.  WTF?  We IMMEDIATELY left and frankly its not worth going back again.  shame  the fish was good there. Crappy hostess for sure. 
n,I am sorry to have to give the Original Fish Market a 2 rating  I could of given it a 3-4 but the service was pretty sad! We sat down for lunch after checking into our hotel room. We waited too long for the waiter to initially great us  and there may have only been 5-10 diners in the entire restaurant  so this is the main reason for a 2  hopefully it s a rarity because the food was pretty good. I had the Cod sandwich   it was hot and tasty  probably one of the better fish sandwiches I ve had. So it disappoints me to dole out a 2 but service is important! 
y,Very nice cheap quick bus service to airport. (28X).  but i think i ve found out what happens to all the old buses in Seattle  they are shipped to Pittsburgh  old polluting diesel buses seem to be the norm.\n\nthey also run the inclines  which are pretty cool if not old. 
y,Port Authority (formerly known as PATransit  or  PAT ) operates a fairly extensive network of buses and (in the South Hills) light rail. Instead of running school buses  the school district gave high schoolers bus passes to get to class  and I have used the bus since 1997.\n\nI ve had a great experience using the bus in Pittsburgh. I didn t get a driver s license until I was almost 19--the bus ( Miss Pat --another nickname) and my bike got me everywhere I needed to go. There will inevitably be delays and problems  but that is common to all modes of transportation. The price is right (especially with a  free  bus pass; students see below) and if you live and work in the city  you should consider making the bus your main means of commuting.\n\nThe system is largely built on the legacy of pre-World War II trolley lines  so the neighborhoods that were developed before 1950 are fairly well-served  while more recent developments can be harder to navigate by bus. The system just had a major overhaul (in spring 2010) but still travel many of the same routes.\n\nThe route numbering system is complicated  and there are many exceptions  but as a rule  the routes are numbered in a counter-clockwise fashion from downtown. The  oughts  and 10 s go north  the 20 s and 30 s go west  the 40 s and 50 s go south  and the 60 s  70 s  80 s an 90 s go east. Routes that are just letters are express or flyer routes  which may go on one of three  busways   transit-only highways that bypass traffic jams. The light rail (known as the  T  or the trolley) serves southern city and suburban neighborhoods above ground  and has three underground stations downtown  with a major construction project underway to extend trains to the North Side  projected for completion in 2011.\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University (among others) have agreements with the Port Authority to allow students  staff and faculty to use their university IDs as bus passes. Others can purchase passes at $75 per month or $20 per week  while a local one-way fare is $2.00. Port Authority is supposed to be rolling out a  smart card  digital payment system (\u00e0 la WMATA s SmarTrip or London s Oyster) soon  but that remains in development.\n\nOne especially great value is the 28X  a route serving the Pittsburgh International Airport from Downtown and Oakland (the university district) via the West Busway. Fare  as of mid-2010  is $2.75  compared with taxis and other shuttles costing $30 or more. The 28X runs every half hour and takes around 35 minutes to get to the airport from downtown  or 15 minutes longer from Oakland.\n\nThe Port Authority s fare revenues cover only a fraction of its expenses  and the state and county s perennial budget problems have caused several funding crises in recent years. 
y,The store is small  but it carries specialties that are difficult to find in Pittsburgh. I was particularly excited to find middle eastern chili sauce and chocolate covered Turkish delights. 
y,Boy do I miss Primate Bros.  I remember going there when the packing district was coming alive at 3 and 4 a.m.  We were coming back from a night of being out  n about with friends (this was in high school/college summers in the mid-70 s).  We would order wild concoction in sandwiches with french fries IN them.  I liked the place so much I bought and wore proudly one of their T-shirts...but alas...left it with a native friend (she also liked it alot) in Koh Samui Thailand. 
y,Salami and cheese is so amazing. Best food in the city! 
n,It wasn t bad  but it definitely wasn t good. \n\nAs soon as we walked in the door the place was jammed back with people who were not interested in seating anyone or telling anyone they would be seated. On one side of the restaurant there were literally two girls working  and one of them was pregnant. You can imagine the chaos. I wanted to have this  Pittsburgh  experience that I ve heard so much about but honestly I was more than underwhelmed. \n\nAfter being seated  it took the waitress 10 minutes to get around to actually saying hello to us and in between that time a large group of people decided to squeeze in a booth behind our table making my friend having to get up every time a waitress or another person needed to squeeze back there.\n\nThe sandwich at best was mediocre. The coleslaw was a bit too vinegary for my tastes and became sickening after the first half of the sandwich. I needed a lot of ketchup to even finish the sandwich. Not to mention I got a nice souvenier of vinegary smelling hands afterwards. \n\nIf you re a tourist  go do it to say you had a colossal sandwich and lived the  Pittsburgh  experience. Apart from that  I don t know why you d return. 
y,a classic. nothing else to say 
n,Clearly should have read a few reviews before going here. Whenever I go to these types of iconic regional dining establishments  I order the house specialty to best judge the place on its supposed merits. Since it was 11 in the morning  I chose not to order Primanti s #1 best seller  which the waitress told me was beer  but perhaps that would have made my experience better. As it was  I ordered the #2 best seller  the cheese steak. It was heinous. \n\nThink a grimy  mechanically separated Salisbury-style steak with a meager slice of provolone on sliced Italian bread served signature Primanti-style: with coleslaw  tomatoes  and fries.\n\nFirst  the steak was disgusting: terrible flavor (smelled and tasted like hippie armpit  which I m not necessarily opposed to as long as it s not involved in something I m trying to eat) with a gross  processed meat texture. Secondly  the fries easily overwhelmed the sandwich  with their old fryer grease taste. Additionally  the sandwich was unwieldy and threatening to fall apart at every turn--a trait I don t hold against decent-tasting sandwiches  but this lack of structural integrity just added insult to injury. \n\nMy dining partners were equally disgusted by their choices: corned beef and ham & cheese sandwiches  respectively. Easily the best part of the meal was the Smallman Street Fries  and those were equally lack-luster. The  bacon  was simply bacon bits (oh  the humanity!)  the chili was uninspired  and the cheese sauce and sour cream did little but soggy the fries. (Did I mention they tasted like old fryer grease?)  \n\nI will never go back and I will immediately disregard the culinary opinions of anyone who thinks Primanti Bros. produces decent food. 
y,When there s this much hype about a place  it s hard to live up to  but they did a pretty damn good job. Maybe not the best sandwich I ve ever had in my life  but if it was any random sandwich shop I d happened to stumble into  it would definitely be five stars without a second thought.\n\nThe chili cheese fries were among the best I ve ever had. I don t know what they do to them - it s not the chili that s particularly great  it s not the cheese that s particularly great  and it s not the fries that are particularly great. But somehow  putting them all together just turns it into unbeatable awesome.\n\nThe sandwich itself (I got the corned beef) was very good despite the fact that I hate coleslaw. But they don t mean the typical mayo-and-carrot-and-purple-onion coleslaw; they make it with vinegar and oil  so it s basically just like seasoned lettuce. They put a bit much of it on  which overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients at first  but just pull about half of the slaw off and you have a kick-ass sandwich. The hot sauce goes really well on it too. And for a pretty reasonable price  I might add. Normally  I d expect it to be about twice as much with that kind of reputation and downtown location. 
n,I ve heard all the hype and wanted to try it.  Tonight was my second attempt here.   First time  new girl on the grill apologized to me at 10 minutes  at 15 I walked.  Not even an acknowledgement from the wait staff.   Tonight  the waiter seemed mad that I didn t know what I wanted to order.  After I explained that I d never been there  he brought me a menu and then proceeded to ignore me for 10 minutes.  I walked again.  No more tries here.  Maybe I m doing something wrong?  Haha. 
n,This place holds a nostalgic appeal for people born and raised in Pittsburgh who grew up eating here. If that experience is what your looking for  please visit. If you re looking for a tasty meal  go somewhere else. 5 stars for history  0 for food quality and flavor. 
y,Awesome tortillas  awesome salsa  pretty good selection of Latin American food products (mostly Mexican  but lots of S./Central American and Caribbean).  I m spoiled from all the Hispanic grocery stores in Atlanta  but this is the best one I ve found in the  burgh.  Prices are average for the Strip and Pittsburgh  but a little high for a Hispanic grocery store. 
y,Even a NYer was telling me to get tacos here  so I did. Pretty good. Loaded more than I m used to. They make their own tortillas which is respectable. It s fun to watch people order tacos here  this is a real taste of Mexico  and it seemed new to half of them. Pittsburgh is a great town because the vendors aren t afraid to give the people something real - they even have tongue. \n\nThat chinese food truck across the street though.... it s good  but way Americanized. 
y,Yes  I went and had the tacos. YES  the lengua tacos. YES  I KNOW!!! They were good. Did you also know that you can buy homemade tortilla chips in hella bulk  along with any kind of sauce you can imagine? If you suddenly need plantains for a questionable contribution to a fireside potluck  you can get those here  too. I m not sure what else you can really ask for in a Mexican food store. Nope  pretty sure they ve got it all. Oh  if you buy a plantain that is pitch-black  or you find that your plantains at home have gone pitch-black  simply slice them open  place in oven  bake until warm and tender  then spread with guava paste (available at Reyna Foods). So the man at the counter tells me. True story. 
y,love the lobster roll.  buttery delicious stuff.  the crab/spin/artichoke dip was also yummy.  i ll go back and try other dishes.  so far so good 
y,I went here for the first time on Saturday night. I had to go & try the famous Giant Fish Sandwich! When it arrived  I was impressed. The fish was even bigger than I expected & the batter was perfect. Also  the beer menu is lengthy! They serve beers from almost every corner of the world! I thought about trying something new  but turns out I was homesick for a good old Pennsylvania beer... :) Roland s is definitely a cool place in my book. I ll be back! :P 
n,I hesitate to even write this review because technically we didn t eat here.  But after reading the other reviews  I thought  Eh  what the hell. \n\nWe came in and were seated at 5:45pm for desserts/drinks.   By 6:05  we still hadn t seen our waitress.  We decided it wasn t worth it and just left.\n\nI did eat here a month ago  and yes -- the fried fish was fried to the point where it was beyond greasy.  And then to pay around $20 for that?  LOL.  Right.\n\nI won t be back. 
y,The people aren t lying. This lobster roll is drenched in butter and guaranteed to be a key contributor in your untimely death. You better love it or leave it alone. 
n,There were 3 of us on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. Surprisingly Roland s was 3/4 full. With 3 waitresses. They were RUNNING to fill orders. \nThe fish was hot and crispy. It was fried but it was good. The French fries with it tasted as if they were fried in the same grease or an oil that should ve been changed several days ago. \nThe Mussels were OK. \nBut the Clams Casino were inedible. The clams were served raw with a burnt bread crumb topping. The crab cakes were also bad. Both went back.  The waitress never asked if we wanted something else or if the rest of the meals were fine. \nThe New England Clam Chowder was good but overpowered by the smoky bacon that was added to the soup. \nNo  we won t go back..the food was lackluster(better fix at Wholleys) and the service was terrible. It took 20 minutes to get someone to take the bill. 
n,Prime time location  and they know it.\n\nYet another older guard restaurant that realizes it has people roped in before they know it.  The place looks nice and is possibly the best location during the summer especially in the city.  I have always steered clear of Roland s because of an assumption.  But....the wife and her friend wanted a  lobster roll  so I was roped into going.  I opted to just drink a draught.  They got one of their famous lobster rolls and immediately were underwhelmed.  The sandwich was dwarfed by a mountain of handcut fries (the best part).  It also came with a limp pickle speer and a small condiment cup of coleslaw?!  The roll itself was lobster  but was fishy tasting and had no sauce?!  There was maybe 3ozs of fishy lobster on the roll.....Pathetic.\nService was decent and my draught and few fries got this place the extra star it deserves.\n\nGo to Wholey!!!! 
n,If 0 stars were possible I d give em. Got back from here yesterday evening and I am physically ill. \n\nI didn t even touch the anemic  yellow and fishy smelling muscles - not that the waiter asked why we hadn t eaten them  more on this character in a moment. My ahi tuna steak was decent  but I think the scallops are what got me and my friend is sick as well. Just saying - check your food before the waiter walks off.\n\nSpeaking of the waiter - one of the worst I ve ever had the displeasure of umm being served by? That sounds awkward and vaguely jack-assy ... Hmm the mild poisoning I have is affecting my wit  but you follow me.\n\nThis guy spilled half the water out of the oysters while trying to put a plate down  and didn t notice or say anything about it when he did; he asked me how I wanted my tuna steak prepared??! \n\nWorst of all he spoke in this low monotone while other customers and cars going by drown him out so all you can tell is he asked you something because he s standing there with this kind of  come on!  look on his face - totally rude and completely inept. I was hard put to give 10% tip to be honest. \n\nI d suggest the similar bar down the road for better quality food and service. Good luck out there! 
n,Last weekend my mother and I headed down to the strip to get some weekly goods - lunch meat and cheese from Penn Mac - veggies at Stans - needed some new spices from Penzeys for a chili I was going to make that day....we were both a little hungry and knew we wanted to have a snack before shopping.\n\nWe parked in front of Roland s and see the sign: Famous for Lobster Rolls and Bloody Mary s!\n\nPerfect. \n\nMy mother got the Lobster Roll  which she said was  good . The bread  from Mancini s  was of course tasty - toasted and buttery - delicious mostly because it was Mancini s bread. I had the Lobster Roll minus the carbs on a salad - and the lobster was tasty  no doubt   I mean  lobster is just - good. For the price though  not sure that I got enough bang for my buck. The salad was something I could have picked up at Get-Go in the pre-made section. I just didn t feel satisfied at the end of my meal. I couldn t even drink my Bloody Mary (this is a rare affair)  way too much horseradish  and I often like horseradish in my Bloodies!\n\nAnd it was cold - didn t even take my winter coat off. So  needless to say  not the best experience.\n\nTalk about false advertisement... 
n,WARNING       this place is for SUCKERS ONLY ..... funky smelling  worse tasting seafood ... overpriced ..... raunchy un-clean restrooms .... only reason anyone goes here is because this is a   tourist trap    type neighborhood with some fun shopping spots nearby and this restaurant is positioned in the center of everything. As P.T. Barnum once said     There s a sucker born every minute    ...... stay away ... any other restaurant will be better . 
n,I liked the bar.   The food not at all. First time here  wife and I sat at the bar and people watched over some WELL POURED drinks.   Strong point.  Then we screwed up and ordered food.   I got their infamous lobster roll.  Glad I had a drink.  Overcooked and dry  dry  dry. I thought lobster roll was generally made with a lobster salad-like mix.  This lobster was dry and chewy.  Lots of it  though  I guess that accounts for the high price.   I went down to Wholeys and got a much tastier one for 5 bucks.  And wife s nachos were just a big pile of chips with some toppings thrown on the top.  Then the other day   we went back and I tried pizza.  Yuck.  The toppings were terrible (pepperoni  sausage.  how can youscrew that up  but they did.)  Two slices and boxed it up so as not to hurt the waitress  feelings.  But it went into the trashcan down the street.  Go for the hootch and not the food!! 
n,I would give them ZERO stars if it were an option. No one came to wait on us. I had to ask the hostess to send us a waiter. We ll call him Mr. Personality because he never did tell us his name. I should have known we were in trouble when he didn t bother to write down our order. My Caesar salad came without the requested onions. My grilled salmon was overcooked. The vegetables were bland. The waiter took away my half-empty glass of ginger ale and filled it with water. He never offered us dessert. The rest rooms were filthy. I would never recommend this place to anyone. 
y,I can t believe this place got a bad rating!!! Sure  it s not a 5-star restaurant  but you can t beat the price or the food!!!\nWhy would you order french fries at a Greek restaurant? I want everyone to disregard the previous bad rating about this place. \nI live about a block away from Salonika s  and I absolutely love it. The first time I went in  I noticed that it was rockin while every restaurant nearby was empty. Very good sign  trust me!!\nSure  there are no waiters. You order at the front counter and linger around until your food is ready  but I ve never had to wait more than a few minutes. \nThe food is absolutely amazing!!! And cheap!!! My boyfriend loves the chicken with pasta  which is exactly what it says it is: pasta with chunks of chicken. It is lightly seasoned  but no heavy sauces. And it s amazingly filling. \nI always get the Greek salad or the pastitsio. The greek salad comes loaded with onions  feta  olives  and jalapeno peppers that are marinated in some kind of garlic marinade. And there is always enough dressing!!! Homemade dressing at that. \nThe pastitsio is definitely an acquired taste. It s like a greek lasagne  but without cheese. It consists of a large layer of very spiced beef  then layers of noodles and a cream sauce. \nI bring a lot of friends to Salonika s when they trek downtown to hang-out with me  and EVERY SINGLE PERSON I have introduced to this place absolutely LOVES IT!!! I usually make them get a gyro  and I can t tell you how many of my friends will go back up for another one because they are so good. The gyro meat is fresh  in fact they carve it right there. \nThere is also a bar in the back of the restaurant. I kind of wish it wasn t there because it attracts some  unsavories  and takes away from the atmosphere in the restaurant. But you can t win them all.\nKeep in mind that this is a cash-only establishment  so hit the ATM on the way. \nYou will not be disappointed with this place. This place is really a gem!!! 
n,Sorry  but I stopped in this morning to get my lunch because I knew I would be too busy to go out for lunch.  Got a Greek Salad.  First of all  there was no lid on the salad  it was wrapped in plastic wrap... What??? Anybody could put anything in there without too much trouble.  Second when I went to eat it  I threw most of it away because the lettuce was brown and/or wilted.  Not going back again.  I didn t spend all that money for garbage. 
y,The Sicilian Pizza is huge  tasty  crusty on the outside  soft in the middle.  The regular thin crust pizza was loaded with toppings.\n\nMy only complaint is that the Pizza was served luke warm.  I want my pizza piping hot  almost burning the roof of my mouth!\n\nThe overall taste made up for the temperature difference  and I was happy with the overall experience.  Both the cooks and the waitress were friendly. 
n,This place was really busy when we arrived so it seemed promising. Some of the food was good and others were sub-par.\n\nTwo of us ate the gyro platter which comes with: \nhummus (watery) \npita (store bought) \ngyro meat (I ve never had gyro meat like this before  it was ultra thin and had a rubbery texture - also the portion was so small) \nGreek salad (iceberg with sparse toppings and too much dressing) \ngrape leaves (vegetarian but quite good) \nand rice (actually this was the tastiest thing on the platter - it had a nice lemon and chicken broth flavor). \n\nOverall the food was hit or miss. The most disappointing were the pita and the gyro meat. My companion had the salmon and said it was unremarkable. I think diners come for the cake which was eaten by almost every person in the joint. \n\nI also have to agree with some of the other reviewers  this place is disgustingly dirty. All patrons walk through the kitchen to use the bathroom which was really gross. The kitchen was not clean and our waiter had food on his hands when he served us. \n\nEven homemade wine and honey soaked cake won t bring me back again. 
n,There has to be better Italian food in Pittsburgh -- I don t know why anyone would come here.\n\nI had an overnight field trip with my students to Pittsburgh & the tour company took us here for a murder mystery dinner show.  They had us sectioned off which was great for privacy & also since the students were loud.\n\nTheir service is a hot mess!!!!  They only had 2 waiters serving our 50 person group & it was not organized at all.  Just getting our drinks out was confusing.  The waiters just came out with any drink & then asked -- anyone order this??  This is why my table sat drinkless  breadless  & saladless for the longest time.\n\nFor our dinner  we were given a salad  entree  & tiramisu.  The salad was definitely straight out of the bag & doused with some cheap dressing.  It didn t taste fresh at all.  There was a list of 8 or so entrees we could choose from.  They came out quite haphazardly.  I unfortunately ordered the fettuccine alfredo -- worst ever.  I could make better alfredo using the sauce from a supermarket jar.  I tried to douse it with pepper & cheese but alas it did nothing to help it.  Some of the others said the chicken parm was alright but some said theirs was undercooked.  The tiramisu also was gross.  It definitely was made & cut awhile ago & just kept cold in their fridge.\n\nThe redeeming parts of this dinner was the decor & old fashioned coin operated games AND the mystery show.  I ve never been to one & was really excited.  They started after we ate our entrees & intermissioned during dessert.  The actors were super funny & interactive -- my students loved them which of course makes me happy.  Seriously though  their food is so bad. 
n,Came here later in the evening on a weekday to an empty building. No host/ess  no wandering servers  no customers... We had to search the place for someone to seat us and the first people we ran into were a couple of off-duty servers who were rolling silverware. The male kindly sat us and got our drinks for us. It took a ridiculously long time for our server to even appear at our table and just as long for our food to come out. To make everything worse  the only other couple in the restaurant who were sitting behind us were complaining to the server about their food. The server returned to their table a bit later (no manager) and said that  the manager  told him that since the food is made early in the day  it can lose texture and flavor by the time it is served. WHAT? Seriously???? It was hard to enjoy our food at all by the time it arrived.\n\nThe food left much the be desired. The service was the worst I ve ever encountered. I don t usually leave complaints on restaurant websites but I had to leave one for this terrible visit. They gave us a coupon for a free appetizer. Needless to say we did not return to redeem it. 
y,Really marvelous art presented in a beautiful setting.  The gift shop is one of the best in the city.  They feature crafts from artists around the world and local.  Shows are well lit and well presented.  Downstairs are studios where they teach classes on metals  wood  fiber  mixed media and book/paper arts (beginning to advanced). They do a great job of hosting outside events and fundraisers. 
y,This review is for the Sam Bok food stand.  I found a review (kind of) for it but I feel as though it s good enough to have its own review.  PLUS  my gal from China Express (now closed  was downtown) cooks there  so I had to make it happen.\n\nThis place is simple.  It has chicken on a stick  mung bean pancakes  & I think some sort of spring roll.  The only thing I ve ever tried is the chicken on a stick  and really  it s all I need.  these little thingers are delicious  and they re only $3.  \n\nThey have two different sauces to dump on it  and I get it with both; one is some sort of Korean BBQ sauce & the other is just Sriracha.  Then it s wrapped in foil  and handed off.  Make sure you get extra napkins  as they re messy.  Any time I run to the strip to get a few staples  I inevitably swing through and get a chicken on a stick.  You should too...you won t regret it. 
n,I used to buy La Prima espresso for my Pavoni all the time so I was pretty excited to actually get a cup of coffee here.  I ordered a cappuccino.  It tasted like milk and no coffee.  I was exceptionally disappointed.  So while the place has a great reputation   even they can screw it up if they don t pay attention to detail  and  at this level they should never screw it up. I had a better cup at Martys Market for crying out loud! 
n,Worst Brazilian wax I have ever gotten. Extremely Painful and inefficient  still had a red welt 3 days later. She also used the same stick the entire time which is not sanitary. Eyebrow waxing is significantly overpriced at $18. Do not go here for waxing! 
y,The ladies here are very sweet and talented. We had 2 bridal gowns that needed a bustle and minor alterations. The prices are very reasonable  the dresses came back perfect   and the length in time getting them back was very fast. Is recommend this shop for any and all alterations. 
y,I began attending the Midwife Center for well-woman care about three years ago  then chose the Midwife Center as my care provider when I became pregnant with my daughter a year and a half ago.  I can t say enough good things about this place  from the inviting atmosphere to the knowledgeable and supportive midwives to the very helpful nurses and lactation consultant.  My daughter was born in the Forest Room  and it was everything I d hoped for.  One of the saddest parts about leaving Pittsburgh for me this past summer  when we had to move for my husband s job  was having to say goodbye to the Midwife Center.  I am hoping to find someplace half as wonderful in our new city. 
n,The location of Redfin Blues is great! It overlooks the river  and makes for a lovely place to hang out and have a few drinks... However  the food and service is sub par. Each time that I have been here  whether it be an extremely bustling Saturday evening  or a slow weekday afternoon  the service has been poor. The food is average  and is way overpriced. There are many other great places in Pittsburgh to go if you want a yummy fish sandwich. \n\nRedfin Blues has the potential to be such a great restaurant! But with the poor service and average food  it has a lot to yearn for. 
y,4 stars for the atmosphere. There are not many places in Pittsburgh to dine along the water and the outdoor seating at Redfin Blues is fantastic-huge outdoor deck with lots of tables under umbrellas. It was the perfect venture for Sunday Funday and I don t know why I have never been here before-well it is pretty hidden. They have a large parking lot and the outdoor seating was seat yourself.  It wasn t crowded so the service was fine but I could see on a busy Friday or Saturday the service would be less than stellar. We drank a beer (they only have bottled beers) and sat by the river to watch the boats go by.  The beers are pricy as our Curious Traveler Shandy was $6.50 each but it was a perfect drink for a hot day!  The menu is mostly seafood and pricey-the buffalo shrip where you only get 5 was $11.  It was only 3pm so we went with an appetizer of cheese fries with bacon and ranch-delicious and how could you go wrong! The fries had a tasty seasoning on them. 
y,The steaks here are very good.  It s the same quality as the other high end places (prime cuts  aged  etc.).  However  I love the fact that they serve them on  platters sizzling with butter.  That s something somewhat unique compared to some of the other shops.  I love the sound of the sizzle as the plates approach the table.  I had dinner a couple of nights ago and while the steaks are top notch the bar isn t that good.  The  bartenders are competent  but the atmosphere is pretty lame.  It s kind of an afterthought it seems.  Oh yeah  and they don t have Guiness on tap.  I m going to start a petition that  no liquor licenses should be issued without a guarantee that the proprietor have guiness on tap.  I mean  how do you not at a steakhouse?  If you  go here for dinner do your  happy hour elsewhere.  The service is very good.  The crab stuffed mushrooms are okay  but they certainly aren t noteworthy.  The mashed potatoes are great and the asparagus is okay  but I think  at high end steakhouses they should have asparagus that is as big as a baseball bat  something you can t get at the local grocery.  Overall a very fine experience.  I d rate the chain steakhouses  in this city in this order for sit down dinners Mortons  Capital Grille   Ruth Chris  Hyde Park.  And  for bar area and bar dining Capital Grille  Hyde Park  Mortons  Ruth Chris. 
y,I wavered between 4 and 5 stars here. If the rating was strictly based on food  I d go with 5  easily. But  it s based on service  too  which is why I had to knock one off. Here s the deal...\n\nI love Morton s. Its old-school interior and no-gimmicks shtick is awesome. Plus  of course  the food is fantastic. However  I wanted to branch out  and Ruth s Chris had some great reviews  so I utilized Yelp s oh-so-convenient Open Table reservation feature  and scored a table for two on a Saturday night. \n\nOur reservation was for 8:30. We arrived right on the dot  but were told to go to the bar and wait. So  my boyfriend and I both got cocktails -- he had Glenlivet  which is obvs hard to mess up  and I got the Peachy Pear-tini  which was delish. And then  we waited. And waited. Around 9  our table was ready. \n\nOur waitress was Kristen  and she was fantastic. Very attentive  friendly  witty  and knowledgeable about the food. Here s our food rundown:\n\n- Barbequed shrimp app: I initially thought was BBQ sauce + shrimp  but it ain t. It s succulent li l shrimp in a deliciously garlicky  white wine-infused sauce with a cayenne kick. Kristen suggested that we dip the bread in the sauce after the shrimp were gone  and we happily took her up on that. \n\n-Ruth s chopped salad: Holy crap. The most memorable salad of my life. I rarely rave about salads. In fact  I think this is the first time I ever have in my life. But  this salad was incredible! It has crispy onion strings on top  hearts of palm (which I love)  and this amazing lemon-basil dressing  among other delicious things. So awesome.\n\n- Filet mignon: My boyfriend and I both opted for the filet. I got mine with extra butter  he got his with a bleu cheese crust. Mine was phenomenal. The sizzling butter really adds an extra dimension of flavor that puts it beyond Morton s. My boyfriend found the bleu cheese to be a li l too generous  and he wound up scraping some off  but still enjoyed it.\n\n- Broccoli au gratin: Again  phenomenal. I ve never enjoyed broccoli so much. Granted  it was swimming in bubbling  gooey cheese...\n\n- Potatoes lyonnaise: We took a risk here  as many people rave about the garlic mashed potatoes  and we saw mountains of them carried past our table. But  it paid off big-time. These were  hands-down  the BEST lyonnaise potatoes EVER. Pamela s has nothing on these. Every mouthful was a medley of crusty brown potatoes and caramelized onion goodness. I dream about these potatoes.\n\nSo  based on that experience  we went back again the next Saturday. Different waitress  same food (literally  we ordered exactly the same items   cause they were so damn good). I don t remember the waitress  name that we had the second time  but we waited longer for food to appear  were checked on far less  she took the cocktail shaker with my extra martini in it before I d gotten to pour it in my glass  our steaks were not done correctly (he got my medium-rare  I got his medium-well)  and it took forever to get the check. I really think it ruins the experience when you re done eating and ready to go  and you re just sitting there  drumming your fingers  looking around the dining room and wondering   Where the hell is the waitress with our check?  \n\nThat said  we will definitely be back. We ll just request to be seated in Kristen s section! :) 
n,Apparently I wasn t important enough with my lunch burger order (even though it was $16.95...) because my server did not come back to see if it was cooked medium  which it certainly was NOT. When I FINALLY got a chance to ask about it  she acted indignant that I would question her then checked her pad  yes  I ordered medium. Then she stared at me. Stared. \n\nI have to say  I have never felt smaller in any restaurant experience in my life. Extremely disappointing and appalling. Will give our business to Capital Grille from now on. I urge you to do the same. 
y,My girlfriend and I were staying downtown for a couple nights and wanted to have a drink close to the hotel. This was the third of three gay bars we went into that night. (we didn t even have a drink at the second one) And it was by far our favorite. Not a lot of female patroons so if you re a lady on the prowl  I would probably go somewhere else. But if you just want to relax in a comfortable  friendly atmosphere with some decent music  this is the place!\n\nThere were two bartenders and we happened to sit on Jeff s side. I m sure they were both quite capable but Jeff was amazing at making us feel comfortable and chatted with us quite a bit until it got later and business picked up. Even then  he made sure we were taken care of. He s pretty much amazing and has great eyebrows.\n\nI guess there was some craziness and fighting by the door and outside as the night got later but we never saw it and it didn t clear out the whole bar. I would expect a downtown bar to have a few problems and it seemed like they were taken care of efficiently. No strikes there.\n\nWe stuck to beers and the prices were very reasonable considering the downtown location. Apparently happy hour runs until midnight! We were able to both have some drinks on the cheap and listen some good music. Definitely returning whenever we re there again! 
y,So fun to have a place like this in the Strip.  I just found out that they have chocolate oranges - I look for these in all the stores during Christmas and never thought to come here - well they have white  milk  and dark chocolate varieties available year-round.  I love the dark chocolate  but only because I didn t know the other two kinds existed!  They also have canisters of malted milk balls  unique chocolates from all over  seasonal items  and a cafe-ish area.  I didn t try the hot chocolate  but I hear it s a must-have.\n\nWhile we walked around the small store  three different salespeople asked if we were finding everything okay - possibly because I kept taking pictures to Instagram and I didn t realize until after I left that there s a sign asking patrons not to take pictures. Ooops!  But no one said anything and they were polite  so thumbs up for the service here. 
y,Cheap! doesn t necessarily mean bad - at least not here at the Stan s Market. However  you will definitely have to check  double check and triple check on some occasions before you buy anything.\n\nWe stop here twice a month to do our groceries - mostly for less likely perishable produce like the garlic  ginger  peppers  baby cucumbers. However  we usually end up buying a lot more than that since we cook on a daily basis. If you happen to buy some of the soft fruits like the strawberries  blue berries or the grapes - you will most likely need to finish it up with in a day or two. If not  you can always freeze them to make smoothies.\n\nLet me say this again  this place is cheap. The prices I pay for the produce here are usually 1/3 of the price I pay at Giant Eagle. So  if you know your produce - this is definitely the place to stop. 
y,I stayed three nights here on business and really enjoyed the hotel and its staff. The place felt clean  up-to-date  and comfortable. All the staff were friendly and everything was easy  from check-in to check-out. \n\nThe rooms have high ceilings and were nicely furnished  and the 3rd floor courtyard even had its own bbq for guest use  which seemed like a nice thought. \n\nI d stay there again for sure. 
n,Ok  but they do not go out of their way to help! I didn t have a credit card so at first they said I couldn t check in. Finally they allowed me to put down cash. Then I went to breakfast  and the shuttle refused to pick us up because  roads were too bad  We waited for 45 minutes at the restaurant. No cabs could pick us up  so I called the hotel and explained our situation (had to get to work soon  5 mth pregnant woman with me  only a mile and a half away). He said he couldn t help. We had to walk while the snow blew in our faces. When we were almost there  we saw the shuttle pull out with the smoking shuttle driver in it  driving in the opposite direction  away from us. I cannot believe how rude they were 
n,Stopped in for a quick drink on new years eve about 3 pm . The place was empty . The bartender Chris was rude and very vulger . He made a crude sexual comment as soon as we sat down . We decided to stay for a drink anyway . After going a couple of choices we were told the bar was out of most stock . On New Years Eve ??? The Bartender kept complaining about his job and bosses for the next 10 minutes . We paid for our drinks and got up and left . Might be the strangest employee experience I had in awhile . 
y,Excellent food  nice beverages  more than fair prices  & great service. Waitress remembered us & was a doll. Owner Elias is a delightful gent & such a really welcoming character. We ll be back. Very pleased. 
n,Terrible. The food they brought us didn t match what was on the menu. They brought out a different wine then we ordered and didn t tell us until we ask. They messed up out bill. They didn t accommodate for a member of our group that had an allergy. The beer was skanked. The soda was flat. Possible the worst restaurant I was ever in. 
n,Worst experience at a restaurant ever.  I don t need anything fancy but this was pathetic.  My coke was colored water  when I sent it back she said they just changed it.  Came back and said we don t have coke  would you like a sprite.  The sprite was flat but I was afraid to order a water after that.  Why didn t we just leave then.  The menu had quite a few spelling errors we joked about but no joke - don t go here.  If I could rate this a zero  I would. 
y,We showed up after a Pirates game to keep the buzz rolling  and this place did the trick. 22-ounce Yuenglings for $4? My kind of place. There were plenty of sports on the tellie  some really kickin  alt rock music  and one of the friendliest crowds of all time. That adds up to a hell of a bar in my book. 
y,My mom called me so giddy on the phone today  I thought she was going to tell me she won the lottery.  No.  Her sofa from Gene Sane arrived.  It made her just as happy.  \n\nShe and I went to Gene Sane a few months ago and found fabric for a sofa and chair.  The fabric was not inexpensive.  Some of that they have is really beautiful designer fabric  some of it is not so special and I am convinced could be found elsewhere for less.  However  they did have excellent customer service throughout the entire upholstering process.  And my parents ended up getting two sofas and three chairs done there.\n\nMy parents live in Oakland in a condo building with a ridiculously small elevator.  Gene Sanes went above and beyond to make sure this extremely long sofa from my grandma would fit in the elevator at my parents  building.  They brought the sofa mid-upholstery to the building just to make sure it would fit into the elevator.  That is such great customer service it is ridiculous.  It did fit  which is great  but their backup plan was to upholster it as two pieces which would then seamlessly be fit together as one inside the apartment.  This is the kind of stuff that high end places in NYC know how to do and even though they ended up not having to do it in this case  it was good to know they have the skills to do so.  They were also great with attention to detail of lining up all the stripes on all the cushions both front and back.  These are the kinds of things that make a big difference. 
y,This place was noted as a  must visit  location during my last trip to Pittsburgh. I must say  it was definitely worth the visit. \n\nTo all reading this  be aware that essentially  this is just a grocery store we re talking about here. However  the rustic building  and kitchy offerings (like pour your own olive oil...or taste our 100cheeses) makes it kind of special. \n\nWhen I was given this recommendation  I was told  head to the back to where the cheese is . So  I did. WHOA - so much more cheese than I ever expected. But no macaroni and cheese....boo. \n\nThey should really consider serving mac and cheese. \n\nThat s all. 
y,The cheese counter and  Dear Heart  really are treasures.  They have all manner of fancy aged gruyeres  tons of olives  and even some sort of disgusting concoction called  pepperoni cheese .  In any case  the place is all kinds of old-world beautiful.  Shelf after shelf of yummy goods  Italian imports...yum. 
y,My family has been coming to Penn Mac for as long as I can remember. My parents make monthly trips to stock up on their very large array of cheeses. The prices are fantastic. For example  parmigiano reggiano at Whole Foods is 19.99 per lb; at Penn Mac it is 14.99 per lb. The service is great  the array of products are huge  and as stated before  the prices are great. \n\nMy favorite products to purchase are:\n\nAll cheeses\nDeli meats\nCanned tomatoes\nPasta\n 00  flour\nCashews\nOlive oil 
y,Unlike many historic theaters across the country  the Harris Theater has been lovingly restored  and is actually a great place to watch a movie.  In a past life  it showed porno movies.  Now it screens eclectic art-house films and other smart selections programmed by PGH Filmmakers.\n\nLocated on Liberty Street downtown  the theater is easily accessible via public transportation.  The concessions are cheap  and the seats are comfy.  What more could you ask for? 
n,After two visits to this theater this week  I want to yellp:  turn up the volume! Or seriously look into purchasing new audio equipment  easier said than done  I know. I felt as though I could hear every movement of audience members and the sound of crunching popcorn made me laugh out loud for some reason  but the point is that I was distracted and did not at all feel immersed in the wonderful film in view. 
y,I adore Prestogeorge. They ve got a ton of freshly roasted coffees  which is great. Also? Lots and lots of loose-leaf tea. I may be willing to admit a small tea addiction  and this is one of my favorite places to try something new. I ve given coffee and tea from here as gifts and they ve always been well-received; it s especially nice that I can get whatever grind I d like.\n\nThere s also a smallish selection of gourmet foods  and my husband likes some of the dips. Then again  he likes most dips.\n\nMy favorite  favorite thing here  though  is the staff. I always end up stopping here and buying SOMETHING when I m in the Strip  because they re amazingly friendly and more than willing to help with any questions. When people go on and on about  back in the day  the mom and pop stores really took care of you blah blah fishcakes   this is the kind of service I imagine. 
y,I liked the decor of the place.  When I lived in Pittsburgh 3 years ago  I was just out of college with no money and didn t care what I ate.  So I spent a lot of time eating bar food  pizza  and $1 pierogies.  I never knew there were  fancy  restaurants until I returned this week for work!\n\nI got the salad with pears & gouda which was delicious with a ton of cheese.  I also had the octopus appetizer as a meal - I was surprised  it s much chewier than I expected.  But the vinaigrette on it was tasty and the red potatoes and kalamata olives gave it a lot of flavor.  The fruity sorbet was good as well.  \n\nI though the service was great and the waiters didn t laugh at me for not knowing half the words on the menu.  They were more than willing to explain! 
y,Get the pasta trio  you won t regret it.  Big heaping portions of fresh pasta delivered to your plate as soon as you have space available. Mmm.  And we went on a Saturday night with no reservations and we re seated in 5 minutes. 
n,My girlfriend REALLY hyped this place up but I ended up spending $110 on a terrible meal I couldn t even eat. I ordered the Chicken Marsala (Waitress s favorite) and it was disgusting. The sauce was VERY over powering and it was drenched in it. If that wasn t bad enough the Chicken was cheap dark meat with the skin and the bones on it. I ended up leaving even though our meals included a dessert with the price. Won t be going back here... 
n,Minimalist happy hour.  Bartenders rude (and it was slow- early in the afternoon). Ran our tab on the card to hold the check without asking if that s what we wanted to do. Chicks in bikinis on the street trying to get people to come in.  Prices too high for strip district beer.  Smelly.  Upstairs looks like it s a club at night.  Rough crowd started to come in as we were leaving.  Good for a quick beer and that s about it. 
y,Mushroom cheesesteak with a Stewart s root beer for lunch today. Freshly made  toasted bun  all good! Friendly service. 
y,The reason for this update is the service.  The hotel itself is still beautiful and the food is above average.  All solid four stars.  I was a bit disappointed initially with some of the pre-arrangements.  In the past I was able to have a complimentary room and the fee waived for the coat check girl.  Friday night because the party was a bit smaller than the last they only discounted the room and charged full fee for coat check/ carving station/ etc.  Now  with that being said the service was over the top 5+++ stars from start to finish.  I get there and am running a bit late. I ask the bellboy Eric how long for a shoe shine  he states its pretty much an overnight service.  I tell him I m in a rush.  He runs downstairs and shines them himself  done in 30 minutes.  While I m waiting my contact for the night Ryan Hunt sends up a cheese dish with a bottle of above average wine.  The party goes off without a hitch  great staff  good food  some discounted wines and good premium open bar.  After the hotel party we are walking outside and run into Eric (bellboy) again ask for directions to other club  instead of giving them to us he walks us to the club.  One of the girls wanted cigarettes and instead of directing her to the store.  He ran down and bought them for her and brought them back.  Btw  did I mention he was done working for the night and just did this off the clock.  The next morning I get a ring around 11 am in the hotel room and its the bellboy bringing up aspirin and bottled water from a long night prior.  Everything about this place is three to four stars.  My main pet peeves are the valet cost ($17 and $25 overnight).  There lack of flexibility in food/bev minimums  but the service is over the top great or at least my contacts were over the top great with service.  You can t go wrong in Pittsburgh for an event at this spot. 
y,Staying in this hotel changed my entire view on the city of Pittsburgh!  The hotel is in an extremely vibrant area and I am not embarrassed to admit that Pittsburgh is pretty damn cool.  The rooms in this hotel are clean and the staff is fantastic.  If you re driving  parking is conveniently located across the street  though the parking garage should come with a set of directions on exactly where to pay when you leave the building (or maybe I m just more obtuse than the average parker).  \n\nThe hotel restaurant has pretty good food and the bar is a great place to hang out and have some snacks (the house-made chips are addictive) and enjoy a nice drink.  And if you have the great pleasure of having Sam as your bartender  you re definitely guaranteed good conversation and a few laughs.  Just make sure you bring up Justin Bieber--she really loves that little fella.... 
y,Great location  Front Desk Staff were very personable. Be prepared to hear fireworks from PNC Park it is right across the river. There is a parking deck across the street with very reasonable rates. My husband and I had a great time here. 
y,My husband and I decided to spend an overnight in Downtown Pittsburgh last minute. We already had dinner reservations and show tickets  we just had to find a hotel room. The Renaissance Hotel is literally next door to the Byham Theatre where we had show tickets. I walked in and there was a wedding on the iconic stairs in the foyer! It was so beautiful with guests not only seated on the lobby space but also in the balconies on the second floor. I came in just as the ceremony was finishing. and when they were pronounced husband and wife  those in the balcony threw flower petals upon the couple. The hotel handled those like myself who were not part of the wedding very professionally so the ceremony would not be disturbed  but still service incoming guests. \n\nCheck in was very swift as my husband went to the restaurant to meet our dinner reservation while I checked into the hotel. I was able to take the luggage to the room and return to the restaurant a couple blocks away without even being late. I really liked the makeup mirror since I have to take off my glasses to apply my makeup.\n\nWe had dinner and enjoyed our show. We got out of the show and went to the bar for a late night bite and a drink. We got there at 10:45pm and waited and waited. At 11:04  a blonde waitress finally came to our table after delivering food to another table. We asked to see a menu  but was informed that the kitchen had closed at 11pm. We finished the drinks we had ordered  but had to pay the bartender because the waitress had left for the night. The bartender was a gentleman as I had two bills stuck together when I paid him and he found us outside to return the other one. We had to go across the street to another establishment to get something to eat.\n\nOther than the snafu in the bar  all the staff from check in to check out were very nice and professional. The room was very clean and comfortable. As the need comes up  I will probably choose this hotel when I need to stay Downtown again. It is so close to PNC Park across the Clemente Bridge and it is in the heart of the Cultural District  so all the theaters are very close by. It is also close to public transit so you can get anywhere in Pittsburgh from that spot without having to go too far. 
n,We got this hotel room via Hotwire at a great price.\n\nThe location was good  although not close to where we were headed while in town. It was easily accessible to the highway. Parking at the hotel is expensive.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that our shower wasn t clean. The walls in the rooms were thin; we could hear our neighbor s dog barking  as well as other people using their showers/bathrooms.\n\nOverall  for what we needed the room for (sleeping after a show)  it was fine. But with the thin walls  expensive parking  and the dirty bathroom  i d never stay at this place again. I ve had better experiences in smaller  cheaper hotels. 
n,My boyfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend because we both had interviews in the North Shore area  which was a short car ride away. We got a very good rate on Hotwire--otherwise I don t think we would have been able to stay here. Although the hotel was very comfortable and in a good location  we could hear every noise from the hallway and adjacent rooms (including the bathroom). I was sitting up in bed reading  and every time the people next door closed a drawer in their bureau the whole headboard would shake.\n\nParking was also expensive. We needed to use the car several times during our stay  so we had to valet park  which was over $20/day (plus tips each time we picked up or dropped off the car).\n\nThe coffee shop attached to the hotel is just OK. The breakfast/lunch place was not very good. You will probably have to venture a bit to find affordable and good quality food (other than the hotel restaurant  which I can t comment on because we did not eat there given the high prices).\n\nOne perk--the hotel does offer free internet  but it is a low bandwidth version. We didn t need the internet for work or anything so it was hard to justify paying for the high speed  so we used the free version. It gets the job done for email and web browsing  but it does not stream videos well.\n\nThe bed was comfortable and the shower head was very good. I agree with other reviewers that the amenities were not as nice as I have seen in other Westins--no bathrobe  room service menu not as good  staff not quite as helpful. Also  because it is a green hotel  they will be a little stingy about replenishing your towels and toiletries. If you have a lot of people in your room or for some other reason require extra supplies  be sure to request that. We came back after housekeeping to find that they had given us a half-full bottle of shampoo to replace the one we had used. Not sure if they had just gotten that from someone else s room (gross!) or it had just spilled and they didn t want to waste it. They also failed to replace our in-room coffee and tea supply so we had to call and ask for more.\n\nAll in all  we definitely would not pay full price to stay here  but might consider it again if there was another great deal. 
n,Really poor service and way overpriced. You could make much better choices.They do not keep to a high standard of service.\nThe rooms are not worth the money. 
n,I had great expectations that were sadly not met. For the price of the room  I was expecting a LOT more for my buck  maybe I was just too optimistic. I will say the whole hotel was clean and didn t have any unsanitary conditions. But it just seemed outdate for the top price paid  it could use a spruce up. Our room was ready before posted check-in time and when we got to the room there were no problems. The wi-fi was free and the tv channel selections were pretty good. I would say this is an average hotel for amenities with a high price tag.\n Usually when you pay top tier rates  I usually expect the service staff to be very friendly  didn t get that here  I think I had one of the service staff actually talk to me unsolicited. I would not revisit The Westin Convention Center.\n My wife would probably give it 4 star just for the shower head  it was pretty amazing  but when that is the highlight  I don t think there is value here. 
y,I ve always loved this hotel. Lovely location right by the river  near enough to the sports venues for a pretty easy walk over the bridges.\n\nCheck in was pleasant as I ve always experienced here  staff were all very friendly and helpful.\n\nRooms were clean but could use a bit of updating; finding a convenient outlet to charge my phone was a bit of a challenge. \n\nOne odd note  you must use your room key in order to turn the lights on in the room. There is a slot for that purpose just as you enter so  take my advice and get at least 2 room keys.\n\nThe restaurant attached to the hotel  a lovely  fine dining establishment called the Old Fishmarket  is slated to close at the end of October  2014...in it s place is going to be a restaurant called  Bill s Burgers & Grill  I hear it is good  but we shall see next time I stay here.\n\nThere is the option of self-parking or valet parking on site at the hotel. 
y,A friendly place with great seafood.  It is cash only. The clam chowder was meaty and creamy.  The onion rings were crispy and so was the fish. A nice place to see local flair 
n,This place is defiantly a historic site! From the floor to the table tops to the bathrooms! I love learning about the history of how places came about. Mary the bartender gave me lots of info.......oldest bar  1st one to let women in  same flooring  etc. \n\nThe food is frozen so if you re looking for fresh seafood this ain t it! I had one of their famous oysters.  Very good I highly recommend getting only 3 very filling. I had the special crab cakes & 2 sides. Imitation crab & lots of filling. So I don t need to tell you how nasty that was. My house made chips were good & cole slaw had very little flavor. \n\nI did notice-after I ordered-everyone was getting the fish sandwich. So I was like dang! I should ve ordered that. My return is questionable. If I go back its only going be for the fish sandwich & oysters! 
n,A friend of mine and I thought we would meet for lunch one Wednesday. I m a fan of Thai food so I thought we would give the Lemon Grass Cafe a try. We arrived a little before noon and were seated promptly. That was the best part of the experience. It took an hour to receive our food. AN HOUR on a busy Wednesday lunch break. There was no sorry  we re working on it ... etc. No explanation at all was given. The food was meh. I ve had much better. I would not recommend this place to anyone. \n\nAs we were walking out a lady was waiting for her takeout order  which she called ahead about. And it wasn t ready yet and she had been waiting over 20 minutes for it. Terrible terrible customer service. 
y,Wow  I m surprised no one has left a review for this place yet. I ve been here quite a number of times and I ve never been disappointed. Service is good and the food is wonderful. This is the closest thing to getting Chinese food from D.C.  You definitely have to get the general tso s chicken. I drove all the way to get some food from here during last years horrible winter storm. When you have a craving  you have a craving. 
y,Great spot for weird or obscure parts  general maintenance items  and to  borrow a wrench or two.  Gerry is like a wise eccentric uncle.   I remember going there for my first time in the early 90 s and it hasn t changed in almost 20 years. 
y,great pizza from the graziano family. \n\ngreat subs  tasty sauces  nice crust  lots o beer.\n\nno complaints what-so-ever 
n,The last 3 or so times I ve visited  they ve been closed 15 minutes early.\n\nOn the plus side  I ve discovered I look damn good with longer hair. 
y,I don t care for the lunch buffet because of its limited options (mostly potatoes and beans for vegetarians  sometimes some previously frozen veggie medleys) and lack of spice (for understandable reasons)  but for dinner  especially take out  I give Peoples 4 stars. \n\nI usually get either Baingan Bartha or Aloo Gobi  as well as a dal and a plain naan. The dals are confusing because there are three on the menu and they only really have two. I ve tried to stop letting that perplex me  but I can never remember the one they don t have and often try to order it. Maybe my take out menu is outdated in that I should cross that one out. Ok  now on to important stuff...I order a spice level of 10 out of 10. The results are dynamite! Instead of using some cheap sauce or hot oil  I can see and taste that they use fresh chillies for added spice. They also use a ton of cilantro and delicious almost caramelized onions in the flavoring of the dishes. Each bite is a mouth explosion. And I love mouth explosions! \n\nThis restaurant has it s shortcomings  but since it s the only place in town that has satisfied the lust of my taste buds for hot oral pleasure  I am a big fan. 
y,I am in town for work and I decided to order food from here. The food was awesome! I ordered the People s Special Biryani and they brought the food right to my hotel room. I will definitely order from here again the next time I m in town. 
y,First of all  a disclaimer. The only thing I have ever ordered here is the Pho Tai. I spent a semester in Vietnam eating Pho on an almost-daily basis  and now it is my comfort food  what I want when I am sick  tired  or sad.\nThat said  I can recommend the Pho Tai without hesitation. Out of the 3 Vietnamese restaurants I have been to in Pittsburgh (this  Vietnam s Pho  and My Ngoc)  this has the best pho. The broth is quite good; fragrant and savory. \nI both eaten in here and gotten take-out. Eating in is a pleasant experience. The dining room is tiny but spotless and bright  and the free pots of tea are a nice touch. The take-out pho is packaged very thoroughly and intelligently. In a plastic tub goes the broth  beef and onions. The noodles are packaged separately in a little plastic bag so they don t get soggy before you have a chance to eat. All the fixings  including copious amounts of basil and bean sprouts  are there  including little tubs of hoisin and chili sauce.\nDelicious  authentic pho prepared by a friendly family. The only downside is the cash-only  which is a huge PITA. 
y,If there were an option to give an extra star for a  special  experience  I would surely do so for Golden Razor. I must confess that I have a really thick beard and my stubble would surely light a match. Well but it did meet its match out here. The shave out here gives me a sense of hope against the injustice of my beard. Also I have been lucky to taste some home made lemoncello from the house of the master himself! 
y,I just moved to the area and went here for the first time the other day. Tomaso did a great job! I high recommend this place. 
y,If you were to base 7 Cees as a restaurant it definitely will get one star.   However this place is known as a grease spoon dive.  That is exactly what it is and by far the very best dive diner that I have ever been too.        \n\n Jeanie is great.  She will be your greeter  your hostess  your waitresses  your personal cook  your bus person  and your cashier.  whew!!!!  Jeanie is not a jeannie in a bottle. She cannot snap her fingers so that your meal magically will appear in front of you.  She is the only person that I have ever seen working in there and you will definitely need time to wait and wait for your food.\n\n Her cooking area is quite small.  Trust me you do not want to question her about where your meal is or how much longer it will take for you to get it.   Jeanie does swear like a sailor  but in a quiet mild manner and NOT like a raging lunatic.  When you come here you will have to except every swear word constantly flowing from her mouth.    Trust me I  hate it with a passion when people swear  but with Jeanie  it is okay.\n\n But with Jeanie  you have to know it is coming and it will be coming in full force.  However while Jeanie will swear like a sailor she greets everybody with a kind and sweet heart.  She will make your order the way you want it.  Beware!!!!!  The portions are huge!!!!!   The coffee is endless. The prices are very reasonable. \n\n So why only four stars when it should really be a five.  Well as I mention Jeanie s swearing like a sailor is part of the 7 Cees experience.  I can deal with hearing damn  mf  shit   etc.  I cannot stand hearing my best friends name being used in vain or as curse words.  When people say Jesus Christ name or God followed by the d word.... I get upset. 
y,Tram has great Pho  and enough of it to feed all of Pittsburgh when the next fake Armageddon rolls around. 
n,I only had Pho so I can t judge the rest of the food  but the Pho was the worst I ve ever had. Biggest let down ever  as I drove here once and it was closed and came back excited to get my fill of Pho at what s apparently the best place in Pittsburgh  but  left feeling sad. The broth tasted like water  and amount of beef and noodles you get was pathetic. 
y,Pittsburgh isnt a city known for its culinary prowess  but there are little gems around town that I can always find myself going back to. Its not about amazing food  its not about cheap food  its about good value  and thats what Trams is. Their spring rolls might not be something to write home about  but the coconut vermicelli is great  and something you are seldom to find elsewhere  in fact  i havent ever had that anywhere else in my american dining experiences. vietnamese coffee is like intense dessert here  and a nice sugary-caffeinated pick me up thats not unwelcomed. Go to trams! get some noodles n at! 
y,Tessaros has a full menu  but if you go there you need  no you must order a burger.   They have the very best restaurant burgers I have ever eaten.   Not greasy  great taste  and they grill them right there in the bar.\n\nDon t miss out on the best burger of your life. 
n,In theory  Tessaro s is exactly what you want -- a casual neighborhood joint in a great location with an acclaimed product. In practice  it s not very pleasant to go there. I don t think they want us there. Every interaction seems designed to make people feel awkward.\n\nThe burger itself  -- the actual cooked meat -- is indeed good  but they have no interest in all the other stuff that turns cooked meat into a hamburger experience.  The buns are poor quality; they absorb juices and toppings so they get sloppy and disgusting after a few bites. The burger just falls apart in your hands (or onto your lap). You have to finish it with a fork.  \n\nThey don t serve French fries  and they seem affronted when you ask for some.  This is a bizarre  given that everything else about the place screams  we have fries here!  Why withhold fries from customers who surely have been asking for them every day for years? This hints at either a weird purist dogmatic sensibility  or deliberate sabotage.  Why not serve fries *and* homefries?  Are they afraid the fries will win  exposing the hollow sham that the homefries have been all along?\n\nI ve come to believe that everyone at Tessaro s is under a spell where they must cook and serve excellent hamburgers  but they hate cooking and serving hamburgers. Everything about the restaurant that is not an actual meat patty is cleverly designed to keep you away. But you  keep going back. \n\nHave some pity for the poor cursed Tessaro workers  and just go up the street to BRGR  or downtown to Winghart s. 
y,Loved this place.  Wasn t sure what to expect.  My cousin told me that they had the best burger in Pittsburgh.  Well  Ria  you were right!   Done to perfection  exactly the way I asked for it.  Not only was the burger great  the potato salad with came with it was just wonderful.  I think  Tessaro s will be on our list of go to places from now on! 
n,I just don t understand the appeal.  I ve tried this place twice thinking that I somehow had a  lemon  of a burger the first time.  And then returned a few months later.  Nope.  The smoked flavor is okay and the meat seems fresh  but where the hell is the flavor?  I can go as far as saying that I don t believe that they even season the burger with salt and pepper.  If I closed my eyes  it is possible that I wouldn t even know that it was a hamburger.  That is embarrassing.  Maybe if you re used to eating 99 cent burgers  Sysco  meat   or at chain restaurants  then you would find this to be  amazing.   I ve had some of the best burgers at many cities in the US and this is an embarrassment to Pittsburgh.  Go to BRGR if you want a tasty burger near Bloomfield.  On the other end of the spectrum were the sides. The sides were classics  but definitely above average  especially the home fries.  I would consider a 1 star rating if it weren t for them.  Additionally  the place is overly crowded and had a long wait during the weekend. The decor is old school and seems satisfied in it s current state.  Just like the food itself.  File this one under Legacy restaurant still living on it s past accolades. 
y,Tessaro s  I kept hearing  was the best burger joint in the burgh. The award  in my opinion  is still up in the air. I have quite a few more places to check out!\n\nA huge plus to Tessaro s for their kitchen! Wow is that thing small. And the two guys working were rolling the burger patties right through the window. AHHH MAZING! I also heard Tessaro s butchers their own meat on site. I love hearing this. \n\nTessaro s is definitely worth checking out. The lunch crowd gets a bit tight as their tables are close. Perhaps try a bit before or after the average lunch hour. Oh  and they aren t open on Sundays so steer clear of that day. 
y,A ton of people told me to try this place  so I went.\n\nIt s very different than most restaurants. The place is old school  but so friendly. My pal and I had a great time! We got burgers of course. We are used to bold flavors and crazy combinations; but you will not find any of that here. They are simple burgers that have amazing taste. I repeat  do not have your hopes up for something that will dazzle you  but the quality is great. The meat was awesome  cooked to perfection. There was nothing gross about the meat  no crunchy or fatty bites. \n\nGet the home fries.... Old school Heinz bottles where you have to hit the 57. \n\nThis place is worth trying. It seemed like a type of clientele that have been going there for years. Time for the younger hipsters to revive it?\n\nTry it. 
n,I have really good food here in the past (try eggplant rolatini) and the local bread is fantastic. Tonight  however  was just awful. Linguini Alfredo was supposed to be  homemade  but it was a far cry from the simple butter/cream/parmesan classic recipe. It was way too thick and absolutely tasteless. Also  my diet coke tasted funny and lack carbonation. My nephew ordered a grilled cheese and I thought they would use the local Sancholi bread  but no. ;(. It tasted like that yellow spray they use on grills. The waitress didn t take the coke off of the bill until I asked. I think of this restaurant as a staple in the neighborhood. I hope that my experience tonight isn t repeated. 
y,Free wing Fridays... oh yeah.  I don t even like wings usually  but Silky s knows how to cook  em so they don t taste fatty.  Get a side of Atomic sauce  which is flavorful as well as hot.  I d buy it by the bottle if I could.  The menu is huge  and everything I ve had has been good.  I always get the home fries on the side  which are cooked with onions and fried jalapenos (!).  Great waitresses  too.  Would be five stars if it had decent air conditioning--in the summer  sitting inside is painful. 
y,Comfortable  friendly  affordable.  Nice stop before an evening out.  I need to head there primetime to assess the evening vibe.  Will be back. 
y,This place is the real stuff. Just moved from portland OR. and its the only place that reminds me of home. Great food  great drinks  and great peeps. If you really wont to experience Bloomfield to its fullest  two words.......Sunday Funday. Check it out and you wont be disappointed. #gopitt 
n,the waitresses are salty.\nthe food is mediocre (at best).\nthe place is a total dump.\n\nhowever  it s open late  and the cook with the mustache is rad.  also  you meet the funniest people ever there. 
n,Disappointing.  The food was below average and the service was ok.  We were expecting a lot from this restaurant but it definitely did not deliver.  Pasta was not homemade and sauces mediocre at best.  Wine selection is very weak.  The outdoor seating is a redeeming quality. 
y,I haven t found Thai food that blew me away in Pittsburgh  but the waiter here was incredibly friendly  and my mock duck dish was solidly tasty. 
n,I surmised two things from my visit to Thai Cuisine:\n\na) the competition among thai restaurants must not be very stiff in this town\n\nb) yinzers wouldn t know good thai food if it flew into their open mouths\n\nThis place was horrible. My fried trout was just a battered butterflied fish not much different from what you d find at a church fish-fry. Insipid  over-battered and generally unpleasant. My dining partner s masaman curry was so sickly sweet it tasted like melted coconut ice cream. Surprisingly  the joint was slammed. \n\nOn the bright side  service was very fast. On the downside  our waitress was definitely stressed out and cranky possibly from waiting on the 14-top of inebriated co-eds across the room from us.\n\nThe takeaway: If you re from Pittsburgh  you ll probably love this place -- it was packed with your kinsmen when I was there. But if you ve enjoyed quality thai food in any large coastal metropolis  steer clear.\n\np.s. food was needlessly pricey given the poor quality. 
n,A year later  prices have increased 70% and the quality of food have declined. Customer service is still superb though. Today  I ordered a pad-see-yew with beef level 5 - was made in an old pan with burnt scraps  25% beef in dish only  there were clumps of chili not blended in the dish  and was drenched in oil. Another dish  red curry with chicken  was always lacking chicken pieces  they ve increased prices and cut back on portions and quality  which happens quite often to good restaurants gone bad. Sad to say  this used to be my favorite place  but now we will never return and we are currently looking for another Thai place to be our go-to. 
y,If you get nothing else here  get the tom kha soup. It is seriously the best I ve ever had anywhere. I m not trying to be hyperbolic. But this tom kha soup is the standard for which I compare all other tom kha soups. I ve yet to find its match. It is truly delicious. I usually get the veggie variation (loaded up with silky smooth tofu and tons of veggies!) but any variation is just as wonderful. \n\nI just returned home from a trip to Thai Cuisine with some friends. The environment is comforting and warm. I love the lights strewn along the windows! They just add to the coziness of the place. After getting the obligatory veggie tom kha soup  I got the green curry with shrimp. Others in my party got the yellow curry and the panang curry and everyone was pleased with their choices. The green curry was a perfect balance of sweet and spicy and the veggies were nice and crisp.\n\nThey were featuring their mango and sticky rice dessert. I had a bite of my friend s and I was sad that I was too full to have a dessert of my own! \n\nAs we rolled out of our booth  totally stuffed and satisfied  we all proclaimed that this was the best decision we could have made with our night. Definitely one of the best Thai restaurants in the city! 
y,This place never fails! Curry is amazing. I always get the red bean curry. The service is always fast and courteous. Perfect to sit in and done or to-go. Its BYOB so feel free to bring a beer or wine bottle. 
y,Cute place...\nI went here after a kickball game with some of my team members.  The staff were fantastic.  I called to make a reservation and they were very nice.  They also called back to make sure it was ok for us to sit in the bar.  \n\nUpon arrival the bartender was very pleasant.  She showed me to the table which was marked reserved.  \n\nShe took drink orders then food orders.  My guests said the food was good but I didn t have anything.\n\nThere are TVs all around the bar and some games to play as well.\n\nThis is a little gem in the South Hills! 
n,Went to Getaway last night for famous fajitas. Not so famous anymore... Waitress brought steaming hot plate after very long wait  she forgot the taco shells  when she finally got back   she brought pita bread instead  I corrected her she appologized and fixed it. The cooked meat was bland   no seasoning  like they used to have.wifes steak was overbooked and dry.were looking for a new place now. 
n,I really don t understand the hype of this place. To be honest  had the personal recommendations from friends not made this place seem like the biggest deal in the city  then I would have probably rated it a 3 or 4. The pizza was just OK. It was decently greasy and the crust wasn t all that special. They wouldn t deliver (Even though I am literally a few blocks from them) and they don t accept credit / debit card - a huge downfall for me. 
n,I have tasted the best pizza in the US  Pepe s New Haven  CT and I have tasted a whole bunch of bad pizza and a whole bunch in the middle.  I am coming to the conclusion that pizza is a very personal thing to people who love it like I do.  After years of people telling me to go here  we finally stopped on our way home from my son s hockey game at noon on Saturday.  Service was okay after we asked the people sitting next to us what we needed to do.  No one spoke up to tell us to come to the counter and order.  But after we figured it out everything was good.  We ordered a large pie  1/2 cheese and 1/2 cheese and sausage.  The crust is very good and some of the best tasting I have had in some time.  It actually had a taste to it not just a bread taste.  After that  everything else is what I consider the personal taste part.  The sauce was to sweet and the cheese was not right to me.  I don t know if they used provolone I should have asked but it gave the pizza a funny taste to me.  I won t be going back  just because my personal taste. 
y,THIS is an old-school pizza shop!  I m sure that many of the foodie-types who frequent Yelp are going to dismiss this place  but having heard so much about it from my local pizza-loving friends about the pie at Fiori s  I finally decided to stop and order a couple of pizzas to go while I was in the neighborhood.  The sauce definitely isn t for everyone - it s a departure from the typical corporate pizza crap that everyone has gotten used to.  But the sauce is INTERESTING  and the crust is PERFECT.  A little too much flour used when it was flown  but I m guessing that s because the place was doing such a high volume of business.  The pepperoni reminds me of the old Mineo s pizza  small slices that curl up and produce little grease pools.  WOW  now that s the pepperoni I love  and definitely not the pepperoni you ll find at Papa John s  or Vocelli s  or Domino s  or Little Caesar s  or Pizza Hut.  This is the PIZZA of your youth - the pizza you remember your dad bringing home  complete with the relic-style pizza box.  It s not in my neighborhood  and I m lucky enough to live close to Luciano s  but if I m hungry and in the vicinity of Fiore s any time soon  I won t hesitate to grab a couple more pies - maybe one for dinner and one for breakfast! 
y,My favorite pizza in the city. Hoagies are also pretty good but the pizza takes the spotlight. One of the best places to shoot pool in the south hills next door  what more do you need? 
n,I stopped at Rohrich Toyota to look at their selection of used vehicles. I was quickly greeted by Paul - who was great! I test drove a Honda Element  which was clean and comfortable to drive  but the brakes on this one needed work - very slow response to stop. Then I looked at a Rav4. The first thing I noticed was dog hair on the interior surfaces. I m surprised that seemingly simple things like brakes and cleanliness would not have been checked and fixed before putting the vehicles on the lot; my confidence was not inspired. I did like the drive course they used because it included big hills and bumps (sure  try to find a loop in PGH that doesn t!). And Paul was easy going and respectful of my search criteria. 
n,First  their clothing is arranged by color  not by size. While thrift stores may think this looks great  it s not great for people shopping for one size.\n\nAlso  their prices were outrageous. Many of the items I liked I could have bought new for a little bit more. The upscale prices did not match the dingy and dirty store. We won t be back to this one. 
y,Stopped by last week.  Store was going to close for a couple of weeks for remodel and I think a cafe will be put in the front.  \n\nThe pita bread is made fresh daily as are many of the other prepared foods.  You can watch the pita being made thru the window in the bakery.  The pita is wonderful and you can pick up so many delicious Mediterranean food items to take home.  Olive oil  olives  cheeses  Hoummus Dip  Baba Ghannouj  deserts  Halva  Specialty Pita Pies.  \n\nGood food and friendly service. 
n,Currently sitting in the restaurant. Got seated very quickly  around 7:10pm. For the first time ever  the restaurant actually had more than myself and my fianc\u00e9 in it. We sat until 7:30 without so much as a  Hello  from a nearby server. People were sat after us and have already received food. We finally had to go up to the front to tell the hostess we had not been addressed. She then came and took our orders herself and finally just filled our water glasses. I ve never received great service here  but it s never been this subpar either. This may be the last straw for this place. Three strikes and you re out  Mark-Pi.\n\nP.S. I ordered a Diet Coke  and received a glass of what seems to be Robitussin. That  or there s alcohol in this drink. Either case  I m not thrilled. 
n,So just finished my meal with my family here and I will not go back! The waitress who I don t know her name because it was never shared was polite and efficient. The only redeeming quality I found in the meal was my 2 glasses of wine! Not that the food was bad it just wasn t good! I ordered Moo Shoo Pork with 4  Chinese  pancakes. Once it arrived I was looking forward to it as the main dish looked appetizing. Then I opened my  Chinese  pancakes... OMG they served me steamed tortillas! I was expecting the crepe style Chinese pancakes and instead I had flour tortillas steamed!!! Growing up and just having moved to Pittsburgh from the West Coast I KNOW a tortilla when I m served one and it wasn t even handmade freshly cooked tortillas that you get at a chain joint like Chevy s but pull em out of the bag from Giant Eagle tortilla! This not only killed the meal but when the $100.00+ tab came I was aghast! My wife and two kiddos had decent meals but just because you serve large portions doesn t mean you re serving 100 dollars worth of food! I felts cheated by high prices for mediocre chinese (notice the little C) food from a place that used to be rated as  great Chinese restaurant but that was back in 1996 as the plaques on the wall gleefully point out; but only seem to notice on your way out! 
y,I ate here this past Saturday night for dinner with three other dining companions.  We arrived at around 7 PM and were quoted for a 35 minute wait upon which the hostess suggested that we go to the wine bar in the back.  The wine bar is not exactly in the same building but is a few feet out of the back door of Il Pizzaiolo.  The wine bar was bursting at its seams for the first five minutes that we were there we could not move much past the door.  Eventually the crowd quieted down and I was able to see a beautiful bar  a fireplace with chairs  bookcases full of books on wine and Italy and some trendy paintings.  After about an hour wait we were finally seated in the main dining room.\n\nThe main dining dining room was nothing special in my opinion as there was nothing that I can remember that really stuck out.  Our waiter came to our table quickly and our group ordered the Arancini since we were hungry.  It came out six balls to the plate on a bed of marinara sauce and tasted pretty good.  For dinner I was having a hard time deciding on whether I should have a handmade pasta or the pizza and eventually decided to get both.  My pasta entree was the Paglia E Fieno which consisted of handmade tagliatelle with prosciutto in a cream sauce.  The tagliatelle was made with either spinach or eggs and the alternating green and beige color combined with the color of the meat gave a nice visual presentation to the backdrop of the cream sauce.  It also tasted wonderful and none was left on my plate whenever I was done.  My pizza was the Diavola since I like spicy things and consisted of spicy salami  chile pepper  basil and different cheese.  Once again the colors were nice and I absolutely loved the pizza  especially some of the pieces where I got what seemed to be larger than normal gobs of cheese.  My dining companions all also complimented their meals and we were more than happy with the service.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely come back here in the future.  The food was fantastic and not as expensive as I had expected while the service was good.  I would recommend that you either get their earlier or later on the weekend though to avoid the large crowd that we ran into. 
y,This place has the best pizza I ve ever had besides Keste and Paulie Gs in NYC.  Wood fired greatness.  Expect to wait on weekends in a crowded wine bar.  FANTASTIC red sauce and olive oil.  Not extensive on the wine list but good by the glass selection. A gem in Pittsburgh. 
n,Rating is based largely on the snottiness of the staff.  We weren t sure if children or non-locals were not appreciated.  We walked into a virtually empty restaurant at 6 on a Monday; got the once over; and the hostess said  i hope you have a reservation.  We have a big crowd at 6:30. You can wait for 45 minutes at the wine bar.  We walked outside and easily booked a reservation on Open Table for 6:15  so we walked back in and were seated right away.  \n\nFood was ok--puttanesca tasted like yellow mustard but caprese was awesome.  We repeatedly got dirty looks from the staff throughout our meal though.  I should mention that when we arrived a family with small children were leaving after finishing their meal and they had a stock-pile of high chairs in plain view  so it was not unreasonable to bring our well-behaved girls (6 and 2 yrs old).  By 6:30  there were still a number of empty tables.\n\nIf you re not from Pittsburgh  there attending college or joining your college-aged child or have small children  I would avoid this place. 
n,I m not sure what the Mt.Lebo hype is about this place. The portions are small  the place is small  and the foods no more than average. I have been there twice now  thinking the first time might have been a fluke. We ve heard so much about it that I have super high expectations. Their wine bar in the back is cute  but small. We couldn t even lift our elbows to sip our drink. While the waiters and service are good  the food is just not impressive. The pasta I got was good  but nothing to write home about. I got a pizza the second time I visited and it had a horrid taste. I don t know if it was the spinach or the cheese but something was VERY potent. They re pricy as well. The only thing I will give them credit for their Italian wedding soup. There s practically nothing in it  as they use think rice instead of noodles  but the broth and meatballs are to die for! Overall  not impressed. I probably won t return. 
n,Just way to expensive for what it is. It s good but not at the prices they choose. $9 for wedding soup? It was good  but not at that price and if I would ve been told it was that much (was a special) I would ve passed. Service was fine  but not attentive and slow  as well. Just so many other good Italian places in the area for half the price. Eggplant parm was enjoyable. 
n,I think this restaurant fits american taste. Because i was the only non american to eat here just now  even though the seats are fully occupied\nIt doesnt taste like an actual japanese cuisine  it is very chinese. And i can smell chinese food right after a few second entering the restaurant. The sushi is not even firmly made\n\nI am not saying the food is bad  it is actually alright\n\n\nBut they have a great interior and place 
n,I came here craving some sushi.  Looked up the best reviewed sushi place in my area and found this little restaurant.  I was excited at the front because it was a small restaurant and I love supporting small mom and pops.  \n\nI figured this may be a little diamond in the rough.  Man  was I wrong.  The sushi was not fresh.  The sushi wasn t rolled tight either.  The rice didn t have the trademark sushi rice flavor. \n\nSpoiled by the fresh ingredients and catches of California  I felt like the ingredients were sort of old.  Considering I went in on a Saturday  I figured it might be better but it wasn t at all.\n\nThe service was good.  That s the justification for the 2 stars.  Otherwise  I really wouldn t recommend this place to other people. 
n,Some good some bad.  This goes for the food and the service.  You MUST check your order if it s to go in any of the locations.  I have had more mistakes than correct orders in the last year or so.  \n\nThe  presses  are MICROWAVES.  They are not training their employees to know this and they are not making it public.  I had an employee actually argue about it with me this morning because I wanted them to toast my bagel and assemble the egg and cheese without nuking it.  I got to my car and they had forgotten the cheese.  I went back and the cook told me that the counter person didn t know if I wanted it!  I think someone should have double checked if this was the case as the sandwich comes with cheese to begin with.\n\nEven Burger King doesn t microwave their breakfast! 
n,This should say it all: we found a dress we loved  it was in our price range  but...we didn t return because of the customer service\n\nI suppose we could have gotten over it to get the dress  but we just didn t want that negative experience to taint our wedding. It was all going so well too. The people helping us were very down to earth  very accommodating and helpful  patient  and knowledgeable. But when we told them that we weren t ready to buy the dress  it was like Jekyll and Hyde and we were given attitude and a cold shoulder. We re talking passive-aggressive teenager-like behavior. Let me be clear - we didn t say no  we didn t say we were going to go somewhere else - all we said was that we weren t ready. In all likelihood we were going to be back in a couple weeks and buy  and just wanted to think about it one more time. It s a purchase that costs thousands of dollars; shouldn t you as the bride be able to take your time?\n\nAnne Gregory is probably the only shop in town worth going to for higher-end  couture dresses. But we ve been to nice boutiques across the country and this was the only one that gave us the huffy attitude you historically associate with those types of places. Disappointing.\n\nA few practical notes:\n- They don t allow pictures. Some shops do  some shops don t.\n- I think there s a private lot but if you end up parking in the strip mall parking lot next door or on the street  the spaces are metered so bring your quarters.\n- always judge for yourself...to get a sense of their collection you can go to their facebook page and see what dresses they ve actually sold. take care not to confuse the posts they make of other wedding dresses and pictures of dresses by actual customers. 
y,The staff and the craft brew selection is great. With games  dart boards and a pool table  the KP is a great local hangout. \n\nLinda 
n,Boring pretentious mall with old dated stores 
n,Racist mall management team same team that ran century 3 mall in to the ground stay away nothing good comes out this place 
n,Worst experience with a hairdresser ever  at this location. Made an appointment with Diane for a body wave. When I was sort of greeted by her she looked at my hair and said  You get body waves?  Yeah  that s why I booked one at your salon. Then she argued with me about when to trim  I wanted after she wanted before  and after five minutes acknowledged that it didn t matter  but FIRST telling me the perm  wouldn t soak in  on the ends unless she trimmed it. Then she argued with me about the rods. It s taken me over ten years to figure out with Aveda perm hairstylists what the perfect combo is. Diane knew better  but finally agreed. Then she proceeded to comb my wet hair  from the forehead back  scratching my scalp and jerking my head. That wasn t enough  though. She then started rolling it with the rods she thought I should have.  I got up and left. When I addressed the problem at the front  NO EFFORT WAS MADE TO HELP me other than to offer coming back and talking to the owner. Yeah. Right. THAT S gonna happen. Horrible salon...dirty  also  just as a side note. 
y,Great products and Katie has been the best! 
n,Internet Connection  = $60 \nWi-Fi router = $120 \nDaily internet pass = $4.95\n\nLosing customers because you make them pay for wifi access priceless.\n\n$4.95 for a day pass or $29.95 for a monthly pass is just ridiculous  especially when the place is so computer friendly with lots of a/c plugs for laptop users.\n\nIf you are going to just have coffee then miss I s review is right on the spot  but if you are going to work or study and need access to the internet then go somewhere else. 
y,They re a great local alternative to Starbucks  and they make kickass drinks! I ve had mochas here  hot and cold  and chai tea lattes here  hot and cold. All were delicious  about the same price as you would find at Starbucks  but they have those cute little stickers for decorating your cup and I m all about the stickers. They re usually seasonally themed and are always adorable. It s the little things  people. 
y,I was walking around and decided to try this place out. I asked for a recommendation on a type of ground coffee to take home. The ladies where very helpful and knowledgable. I love the coffee. Thank you. 
y,Great place to study considering I ve spent entire afternoons and evenings there cramming for exams. The staff is really friendly and if you get a ceramic mug refills for coffee are free! 
y,I don t normally come to this laundromat  but the machines in my apartment had been broken for a week and I was getting desparate.  Although parking can be a bit of a pain  I was pleasantly surprised with this place.  There are plenty of washers and dryers to choose from (from regular sized to freakin  50 pound capacity) and they all seemed to be working great.  It s air-conditioned and clean with vending machines and some old arcade games to spend some more of your quarters on.  My sister and I did four loads of laundry and it cost us about 2.75 per load.  Oh yeah  and they have a change machine that apparently takes 20  10  5 and 1 dollar bills.  If I am ever in a pinch again  I will be coming here. 
n,Ick.  Stay away unless you want to be treated like you are a criminal who cannot afford a pricey item.  I wanted to try on a $400 fur...and the guy said it was very expensive and would hand carry it to the front mirror for me.  He then advised me to take off my vest and waited for me to do so.  He would not let me handle the coat myself because it was  very expensive.   He watched me while I tried it on and then immediately took it off me.  I wanted to tell him that $400 wasn t pricey for a winter coat and that I could easily afford it  but decided to walk out without purchasing it.  I won t be back. 
n,I hate to put two stars  but.. I have experienced better. Especially for the price. This was my first visit  and  frankly  it made me want to go back for the bar but not the restaurant.\n\nThere were definitely good points. The service was great  and I enjoyed the cocktail that I ordered off the menu. Also  they had a couple of lesser-known cocktail classics that made me think the bartending staff know their thing. The wine by the glass menu had nice choices  too.\n\nUnfortunately  the food was mixed. I had the pork dumplings for an appetizer. The combination of flavors in the filling  dip and wrapper was very good  but the wrapper was unusually thick and distractingly chewy  even gummy (as in  it stuck to my teeth and the roof of my mouth gummy). The server said they d just started making their wrappers in-house  and I think they need some work.\n\nI had the chicken ramen soup for a main course. It just wasn t very good. I didn t expect it to be up to Vancouver BC standards (that city seems to have a thing for ramen)  but the noodles were a bit tough  and a whole lot of the flavor came from salt. This includes the broth and the chicken. I didn t really want to eat it; I just tried the leftovers  and I don t really want to eat them either.\n\nIf the food were at 2/3 to 3/4 of the price I d give it three stars. As it is  I wish I d gone somewhere else. Clearly  other people love the place. Maybe I ll give it another chance  if I m with friends who want to go. 
y,pretty good food  fantastic atmosphere  slightly overpriced  but not unreasonable for the quality and atmosphere 
n,Hands down the most disrespectful and terrible lounge in pittsburgh. Appalling \nservice  I went there with 6 people  restaurant was empty and sat there for twenty minutes with staff walking by. The lounge was empty  was there from 8-11 she didn t check on us once  we had to flag her down   complained to the manager with no response. NYC prices as well  very embarrassed for the big burrito company. 
y,This is a better than average- let s say very solid-  sushi restaurant.  \n\nWe had the omakase and had some delicious bite sized courses.  But strangely the little bites never added up to feeling super full (which could be a good thing  but devouring a chocolate pretzel dessert isn t really the perfect end to omakase).  \n\nThe miso black cod was excellent  the sashimi was well executed  and clearly the chef had many  many years of traditional sushi training.  But for some reason my socks just weren t blown off.  More sushi and sashimi could have done the trick.\n\nOn the other hand the desserts were delicious and memorable (which come from the restaurant downstairs- Soba).\n\nGreat atmosphere  attentive service and will def. go back.  At the same time  I m open to finding alternatives in Pittsburgh (too optimistic?)\n\nAnd Dr. Freddie Fu is a fan (see autographed picture on sushi bar).  Not sure what this means  but maybe if I return I will be further enlightened. 
y,Umi is alright.  What I mean by this is that the food is high quality  and the service is high quality  but for some reason  I m never completely satisfied when I leave.  Let s start with the good:\n\nThey have great quality sushi.  They have interesting taste combinations.  The decor is fun  especially if you sit in the  traditional  seating area where you don t actually sit on the floor (if you can ever manage to get in and out of this seating in a graceful manner  kudos to you).  \n\nBut  the portions are small  and every time we ve eaten here  we come away with the sense of   great meal  but holy moly.  Dunno if it was $XXX good.   We ll continue to come  but probably only if someone else is paying.  In the meantime  it s off to Tamari we go. 
n,Harris Grill was long one of my favorite spots to goto just about any night of the week.  However it s changed in recent months and I don t think I will return.\n\nOn a recent Thursday night  my friend and I had possibly the worst waitress ever.  Her name was Amanda and this is my story about her as our waitress.\n\nShe was not present for about 15 minutes after we were sat.  She finally appeared and asked us for our drink order. She disappeared for about 10 minutes before returning.  She served us our drinks then immediately left for another table. It was another 5 to 10 minutes before she came by again  this time taking our order for food.\n\nShe return 5 minutes later with another round of drinks which we don t remember ordering  but we weren t going to complain. We never saw her the rest of the night.\n\nOther waitresses were making their rounds every 5 minutes out on the patio  but ours never appeared once.  I thought she may have died in back in the kitchen or was burned beyond recognition.  I even asked one of the other waitresses out of concern for her safety if she was okay.  She said they would check.  She returned not long after and said she was alright.  I relaxed a little  until another 15 minutes went by... it was now about 30 minutes since we had ordered and no food.\n\nWe waited a bit longer  we still hadn t seen Amanda (our waitress for those paying attention).  An hour went by and we had had enough. I really couldn t believe this.  Not only did we not have our food  but we hadn t seen our waitress in an hour.  An hour.  What the hell? 
y,No complaints about this place. I tend to gravitate towards this place mid afternoon with my laptop...love the vibe here. Outdoor patio or  NICE window seating upstairs. Creative menu as well. Check it out! 
y,We went to Harris Grill for lunch while a friend was visiting from out of town-and it was fun! The menu and atmosphere is pretty entertaining. The food and drinks are moderately priced  and there is a nice selection of brews.\n\nWhat we had:\n\nTurkey Burger-fabulous-we agreed this was the best thing we had ( I added mozzarella cheese and it was soooo good)\n\nFlat Iron Pork-I guess our friend thought he was ordering flat iron steak-this was ok but I wouldn t get it again.\n\nSome Spicy Chicken sandwich-Pretty good-paled in comparison to the turkey burger\n\nTots-Delicious\n\nBeer-good! (duh)\n\nOther:\nService-Fab!\n\n2 Patios-front and back 
n,Overall a decent yet confusing experience...\nPros: it s like living in an apt. because it s spacious and has a kitchen and laundry room downstairs. There s even free laundry soap available in the laundry room. It s located next to a lot of restaurants and shops. Some of the staff has been friendly in providing things  including shuttle rides.\nCons: Extremely inconsistent room cleaning service! If you re staying for an extended period of time  they only clean your room once a week on an assigned day. The problem is  they don t show on the assigned day to clean. My roommate and I have ended up calling the office  sometimes twice before it s cleaned. Also  someone in our  building had $1 900 stolen out of her drawer  and the management told her not to call the cops. They ended up cutting her check  but not before a lot of stern talk. I wouldn t stay here again...if you do  make sure that you use the safe provided in the room  and expect to do a lot of the maid services yourself. 
n,Since my return to Pittsburgh  I have been to the  new  Elbow Room several times. The food has always been decent and the location on Walnut is convenient when I m in the neighborhood shopping.  \n\nToday I went for a late lunch.  Honestly  there were 5 people in the restaurant.  It took forever for food to arrive at our table.  Could it be attributed to the fact that I was eating somewhere between lunch and dinner and they aren t sufficiently staffed?  I don t know.  My beloved was happy as always with his ENORMOUS fish sandwich.  My reuben sandwich was just okay.  The corned beef was pretty chewy.  Probably should have gotten a salad.  \n\nI m hoping that I just caught them on a bad afternoon. 
n,I don t know how this place has stayed in business for so long.  It has never appealed to me  yet some family member drags me there every five years or so.  It never changes. It seems like an independently owned Chili s.  The menu is boring.  The food nothing special.  \n\nMost recently  I ordered a salad and asked for some rolls or bread and they didn t have anything except for some super spongy Italian sliced bread that tasted like a step up from wonder bread.  My beet salad had such crunch beets they were barely cooked.  Grapefruit segments were all membrane.  Lettuce was ice cold  nearly frozen.  \n\nSee you in another five years. 
y,I got a groupon for Dean of Shadyside for hairline highlights  deep conditioning masque  and a hair cut for $35.  I had never been  but I gave it a try.  The groupon was for a level 1 stylist  and I had Erika.  She was pretty great!  I ve never had highlights before  and she helped me figure out what would look good.  My highlights look great  the cut looks great  she did exactly what I wanted her to do!  I never make hair appointments far in advance  but I pre-booked my next appointment!!!  I would highly recommend this place  and I recommend Erika as well! 
n,Let me start by saying I was given a coupon for a free haircut and mani.  You have to really let me down with free to get a two-star review.\n\nTHE HAIRCUT.\n Let s put it this way--after I went home and re-washed and re-styled it  I was really happy with it.  I really liked the girl I had.  I thought that she cut it just how I wanted.  But then she asked if I wanted her to straighten it  and I said no thanks because I have wavy hair that s pretty easy to make fancy (read: easy as in I don t use products or heat almost ever  thanks) even though it s quite long.  Somehow  she made my wash  n wear waves into a frizzy stuff hot mess with some combination of gels and spray.  Then  she told me she was going to dry my hair to 90% dry before sending me to the mani and then check on me later.  Okayyyyyy.  Overall  haircut & style = 3 stars.\n\nTHE MANI\nThis mani brought down the average rating of my visit as I d give it one star.  I haven t gotten a lot of manis--maybe a half dozen times for fancy events--but I know a bad one.  It was freaking dirty at the mani station where a different girl did my nails.  The towel the girl put out had large brown stains on it!  Seriously  get some bleach.  Then I figured out what the stains were...the girl made me bleed on two fingers while cutting my cuticles.  One bled quite a bit.  But she just pretended like it wasn t happening and continued to chatter on about Black Friday shopping and her plan to score big.  Had the mani station not been in the very back of the salon  I would have ran away when--this is true--she got up to use the restroom in the middle of mani.  Um  I usually do my own nails  but I m guessing this isn t normal.  As if she were aiming for the worst mani ever  the polish wasn t even within the lines at all.  Then  she had me sit around in a weird corner while my nails cured and said she s get the stylist.  Mani = 1 star.\n\nThe stylist didn t come back after a couple minutes.  When I asked the receptionist where the stylist was  she didn t know.  I just wanted to get out of there.  So I took off the smock and left with wet hair and nails.  I was pretty bummed since I had specifically scheduled the appointment on that particular afternoon because I had a big event that evening.\n\nI actually felt like a sucker tipping at more than 20% for these services.  But I had put the tips in the little envelopes before I got my nails done and I didn t want to wait for them to dry to decrease the tip.  So I tipped and left.\n\nSummary: Free isn t great when you have to go home and immediately wash your hair and remove the nail polish. 
n,Went to a High Tea here on Sunday.  Although the setting was lovely and the staff was welcoming  the food was nothing special  in fact  it was bad.  We were served three tea sandwiches:  egg salad  which was bland (I make a better version at home)  chicken salad  nothing special either  and then a delicious spinach-artichoke bite.  Unfortunately  it was the size of a quarter  it was literally a bite.  But it was the best part of the meal!!!  (I don t think the size of all three of the sandwiches put together was as big as one piece of white bread).\n\nWe were offered two types of scones:  cranberry and eggnog.   Neither was anything special  eggnog had absolutely no taste whatsoever!\n\nThen  the pastries:  we were served a gingerbread cupcake which was fine--nothing like Vanilla Pastry Shop!  A pumpkin torte  again  fine.  And a chocolate mousse/brownie bite with a raspberry and candy cane on top--it was dry as a bone!  It looked as if it was on it s last legs--chocolate was turning white  mouse separated from brownie.  Yuck.  \n\nOh yeah--I had a delicious tea from Harney and Sons (used to be sold at the Grand Floridian High Tea in Disney World)  cinnamon spice!!!  Unfortunately  when I asked for more tea  they gave me new hot water and the same old tea bag! \n\nI ve gone to various teas so I feel I can give a good comparison.  Not impressed at all!  Will not go back there  ever! 
y,First  Giant Eagle is convenient. It open early and closes late on a daily basis. I have yet to find another store that sells the same variation of food in a unitary complex. And despite its size  the supermarket is clean  and the employees are knowledgeable on the status and location of most items.\n\nSecond  the prices for non-produce items are competitive if not better than nearby competing stores. The produce items tend to be more expensive  but  to be fair  nearly all if it is fresh.\n\nThird  Giant Eagle offers a brand guarantee and a return policy which assure customer satisfaction; that is  you can return items you are dissatisfied with. Obviously  this is a technical component that is rarely considered when food shopping or dining; however  it is nice to know that the company has a firm faith in the products it sells. 
y,You can speak to maurice about adding brewskis to the  make your own six ~pack  if one you want isn t there! ;) 
n,I never really understood why Doc s was so popular.  I personally find its only real saving grace to be the outdoor deck.  Otherwise  the prices suck (beer served in 10 ounce cups on special for $2.50 - come on)  the food is mediocre  and the atmosphere is nonexistent.  The drinks are weak as well.  \n\nIf you re looking for a night out  there are better places close by in Shadyside.  The deck really is nice  but it doesn t help the fact that the prices are terrible for drinks  especially for what you get.  That being said  I end up here a lot because others seem to like it...maybe I m missing something. 
y,Food: very good  seasonal menu with at least 3 vegetarian friendly entrees when I was there (soups weren t veg-friendly)  all three entrees we ordered  particularly the gnocchi  were excellent  house dressing is good too\n\nDrinks: full liquor selection and good beer choices too\n\nAtmosphere: we sat outside  and the patio is great  unique arrangement  feels very European\n\nService: prompt  friendly  overall very good\n\n(+): connected to Creamery upstairs  so if they run out of a specific desert  always great options to bring back to your table\n\n(-): could have used more bread  both in the basket and refilled more often 
n,My girlfriend has been a regular of this place for years and could not wait to take me when I came in town for the Steelers game. We did not make a reservation and showed up on a busy saturday night around 8:45pm fully expecting a long wait. My girlfriend had forewarned me that there will be a wait so when we showed up we just expected to put our names down and go across the street for a drink while we waited. We ended up waiting in the front of the restaurant for ~20 minutes without anyone taking down our name. A few waitresses mentioned that the older italian guy (owner) took down names. We were ignored several times by him as he came up front - no biggie we saw it was busy. An older woman came up to us several times and asked if we had been helped  we replied no  and she reiterated that the older man dealt with the  list . We were fine up through now and were still waiting when the older guy came up to the front and shoved the older woman (his wife?) and proceeded to scream at her for several minutes. The entire restaurant went quiet and was staring at the front of the restaurant (where we were awkwardly standing as well). The older gentleman was screaming that she was always interfering with the list and he was done with it. He kept going on and said that why did she even care about a couple of  out of towners  who will never come back again. (which was even more shocking because my girlfriend was a regular and had regularly conversed with the man many times before). \n\nWe subsequently left while the man was still screaming at the woman. This was the most absurd display at a restaurant I have ever seen. My girlfriend was extremely upset especially for the physical violence the man was displaying. This was no casual shove but rather a full two handed violent push followed by pounding his fist on the table and screaming at the woman in front of the entire restaurant. Needless to say we will never come back and recommend people boycott a place where the owner treats his (wife/employee) with such disrespect regardless of how stressed he may be on a busy night. 
n,Beware the loud-mouthed lout working the front. We stopped by a couple nights ago and asked to check the menu. Finding it acceptable -- despite an abundance of starch with minimal protein -- we walked away to go find the other members of our party to return and ask for a table. But we were accosted by a boorish old man who kept yelling  Hey!  until we turned around to see what he wanted. Come to find out he wanted to insult us by telling us to check out the hamburgers across the street if we didn t want or couldn t afford his fare.\nWell  needless to say  we didn t go back and had a fine dinner elsewhere. Tip to the house: Insulting the public is no way to win friends or customers. 
y,Never had any experience with rudeness here  or any other problem. They make the best beans and greens around (and I order this dish at every Italian restaurant) - brothy  just the right amount of saltiness  and just right for sopping up whatever s left on the plate with their delicious crusty bread.  The salad with Gorgonzola is also pretty amazing.  A great neighborhood standby. 
n,I am a nice  amicable person. I treat others with kindness and have a highly positive attitude. I rarely complain about things. Thus  it makes me sad to write a negative review. However  the way in which Mozart Management Staff have behaved and conducted themselves over the past two years warrants this review. We moved to Pittsburgh when I was in graduate school. We loved our tiny  cute apartment at Schenley Arms  our first home as a couple. This abruptly changed when simple calls to request that they salt the driveway were met with aggression  irritability and statements such as  we have never had a complaint before  and  we cannot accommodate your schedule . I felt guilty at first about calling  but then had an epiphany and realized that Mozart has serious issues. The tone of their written  correspondence is also highly intimidating  demeaning and threatening. I will not bore you with the additional myriad of complaints that exist. What ever happened to customer service  decency and basic regard for other human beings?    \n       If you value your hard earned money and do not want to be met with criticism and hostility when interacting with your landlord..AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Also  there are a fair amount of negative reviews when you do a search on Google..READ AND BELIEVE THEM. They are completely mean and disrespectful. This is not the kind of business I want to support  as it conflicts with my value system. We are moving out ASAP when our lease expires. \n\nPS the maintenance staff are fabulous and deserve 5 stars! I hope they aren t treated as bad as the tenants. 
n,They just broke into my house without any notice to show around. They knocked so violently I almost mistaked it for gunfire. Then  before I was able to say anything  they broke in. There was at most 2 seconds interval between the knock and the break in. I wasn t dressed  and the guy just said  Oh hi  we re showing the apartment   and stormed into my kitchen. Ridiculous. I started ranting as soon as they left the room. This is totally invasive and disrespectful. I didn t read their lease very carefully when I moved in and I totally regret it (they shoved it to me and told me everything must be signed by the end of the day  so I thought whatever  how bad could it be?). Apparently  breaking into the house without any notice is written into the lease here  and if you don t comply  they ll fine you as much as your unit s monthly rent (around $1000 for telling them no you can t enter the house). I ve heard of several cases like this. They re unbelievably hostile and try to juice as much out of your pocket as possible. 
n,Breakfast is always good. But too much Pamela s seems greasy. You can cook it all at home for much cheaper. However  the pricing really is low when you re lazy. The wait is ridicious at times. I would recommend the Shadyside location over the other two. It s more clean and better parking. Cash only. 
y,Woah. Thank goodness for yelp. That s how I learned about this breakfast gem. The boy just moved to PA so we went out foraging for breakfast  but before I did  I did a quick Yelp search. We headed to Pamela s as soon as I saw the reviews. \n\nThere were about 15 people hovering outside so went in to put our name down. Here s my only complaint. We waited patiently in the line while people paid to put our names down  but then about 6 people just cut in front of the line  which was a bit rude. \n\nThe seating is tight  but the atmosphere diner-esque. Upon the walls are some differing varieties of art (some for sale  no less). \n\nThe menu  while not particularly health-conscious  was heavy on eggs and pancakes. We went with the specialty pancakes  banana-walnut and choc. chip.  Both were delicious. I really wanted to and tried to finish mine  but I just couldn t man up. \n\nThe other complaint  which is of no-fault of the restaurant  was the mother of teenage boys next to use who repeatedly started screaming at them and causing quite the scene. Despite the deliciousness of the food  things got tense for a while. \n\nI think the next time I have a serious pankcake-hankering  I ll find myself wishing Boston had a Pamela s. 
n,Two words: grossly overrated. If I am going to wait an hour for breakfast/brunch  it needs to not only be good  but also unique. Unfortunately  Pamela s is neither of these things. Then again  the hour-long wait does provide you will ample time to find a ATM because they only take cash. If you want to wait in line for an hour for food that is both good and unique  try Coca Cafe. 
y,I m from California and hotcakes is something that s not common in our food vocabulary. We just settle on pancakes and call it a day.\n\nMy brother took me and my mother to Pamela s for brunch and it was pretty packed. Fortunately  it was only a 10 minute wait and a huge crowd came in after us. I glanced through the menu and learned that they re known for their specialty hotcakes. They all looked very good  but settled on the the strawberry hotcakes (was craving strawberries). We finally got seated  ordered what we want  and chilled in the lively atmosphere of the diner. The food came out relatively fast and I was ecstatic for my hotcakes. They use FRESH strawberries instead of the syrupy strawberries in a can! The hotcakes were thin like a crepe and the crispy edges were the best part. A bit heavy on the butter  but that s how you get the crispiness. The sour cream surprisingly worked well with the strawberries  as it balanced out the sweetness from its tart element. As for the brown sugar  that was like the cherry on top. It was pure harmony.\n\nDefinitely check it out when you re in Pittsburgh! 
n,I like Chinese food.  Americanized or authentic  from the streets of Wuhan or a plaza in Monroeville  I have enjoyed it.  In light of that  China Palace on Walnut Street is... well... kind of okay.\n\nThe positives: \n\nThe vegetarian menu has an especially good selection.  I m not a vegetarian  but I usually order from that menu just because it s something different.  The food isn t terrible  either  but it s not great.  It s also usually easy to get a table (last time I went there  I tried to go to Pamela s first  but it was a Saturday afternoon  so there was no hope of getting in.)  Oh  and the lunch special pricing is not bad at all.\n\nThe negatives:\n\nDim lighting that makes me want to sleep.  It s not romantic  just dim.\n\nThe only waitress I ve had there is pretty rude.  She s just not cut out for waiting tables  or interacting with people in general.  My minimum tip is $5  even at the cheapest places.  She got $1.60  because she didn t do the minimum amount of customer service I require to give my minimum tip.\n\nThe food is only okay.  \n\nAll in all  if you re on Walnut and you can avoid China Palace  try something else.  You won t HATE your experience here  but it won t be memorable  either.  I will probably return  though  for the cheap lunch specials  but that s because I m moving out of country soon and I need to save every penny I can  not because I really love the place. 
y,We order takeout here several times a month. The food is always very good  and quite plentiful for a take-out order. The quality seems pretty consistent as well. They even called me back once to double check something on the order. That was really nice. Delivery times are always good  and they re very fast on slow days. Meals in the restaurant or also high-quality. My wife and I have probably eaten here 40 times in the last five years. 
y,Had lunch with my husband here yesterday after not eating here for years.  We shared the tuna sashimi and wild mushroom flatbread as apps.  Both were delicious  and I m freaking thrilled when a restaurant knows what a caramelized onion is supposed to look like!  My flatbread was smothered in them  just the way I like it.  The sashimi was nothing crazy  I liked the grilled pineapple with it.  \n\nMy husband got himself a burger  the barbecue one  to be exact  and I had the wild mushroom pasta.  I was concerned it would be too similar to the flatbread  but the server raved about it  so I tried it anyway.  \n\nMy husband enjoyed his burger  though he thought it could have been less salted.  He was happy that the temperature was correct  also.\n\n The salad that came with my entree was... Ok.  The blue cheese dressing was eh  the cherry tomatoes seemed kinda squishy  and I actually spit out a crouton.  It had this weird feeling in my mouth of being a tasteless cube of crunchy oil.  I usually love croutons too.\n\nThe pasta was tasty  but almost too tasty  if that makes sense.  Too many competing flavors.  My husband was thrilled that they got  al dente  right  when he had a bite.  I d also note that the pasta is much more of a dinner meal than lunch  but there aren t a ton of options for people trying to avoid meat.\n\nOverall  I d eat here again  and get the same apps and a lighter entree. 
n,This restaurant is in a great location and has nice ambiance. That is where the positive ends. The food is LOUSY. I paid $9 for a stainless steel mixing bowl of iceberg lettuce with a little frozen (OK  it was thawed  but had previously been frozen) corn  about 4 tablespoons of black beans and the same amount of feta. As a vegetarian  this salad was one of two that had some sort of substance to make one think of a meal. What a disappointment - I won t be back. 
n,Everything about the pedi was ok except the polishing part.  12 hours later I had to wear shoes  and the polish smudged because it was slopped on so thick it never would have dried. \n\nAs she was polishing my nails  I was thinking   Man  that is way too thick!  It ll never dry!   but I didn t say anything because I thought maybe she had some super topcoat that would make the impossible possible.  Well  she didn t  and the polish stayed not just tacky  but downright WET for 4 hours  before I finally just SCRAPED the goop off and painted them myself.  \n\nI will never be back  and wish I had saved my $30 (I had a Groupon) and my $15 tip.  Should have just done them myself. 
n,Our wedding cake and dessert table vendor was included in our reception package so I m sure the owners are going to say we didn t pay them directly so what I write doesn t matter (I ve seen this response in other negative reviews).  In my opinion  that should not matter.  We should still receive the same type of respect  courtesy and professionalism that all clients *should* receive.  This was not the case.  I won t rewrite what I posted last year about our issues with the dessert table and the attitude of Linda  but what I am posting about now is our 1 year anniversary cake top.  We were given a certificate in our package for a free  fresh cake made in our *wedding cake flavors.*  Linda even wrote the flavors on the card.  I was really excited to taste the cake since my husband and I didn t really get a chance to during our reception.  They gave us a plain chocolate cake with white icing.  This is not what our wedding cake was.  When I called and asked if there was a mistake I was told someone would call me back.  Of course  they didn t.  So  I called again and spoke with Steve who LAUGHED at me when I asked why we didn t receive a cake in our wedding flavors and then had the audacity to say  well  you got a free cake.   Really?!  It wasn t good and it was a plain cake I could have made myself.  When I said  that s not the point  he said  what do you want me to do?!  Another cake  fine.  When do you want to pick it up?   When we picked up the second cake  again  in was the SAME cake as before.  I have yet to try my own wedding cake flavor.  They are so rude  cocky and ignorant.  I will *never* go to the bakery again nor will I ever recommend it to anyone else. 
n,There were six employees behind the counter and one customer waiting for their sandwich to be made  and I was the only person in line and couldn t get a single person to take my order.  Walked out and got faster service at Panera  which had a line out the door.\n\nOh well. 
n,Please don t go here. I m begging you. I wouldn t wish this place on my own worst enemy. I wouldn t wish this on the girl who cheated on my best friend. This place was a literal nightmare. .\n\nI think I ve been to Jimmy Wan s 4 times this month  so I was sick of it. Plus I d heard good things about TaiPei  so I thought I d give it a whirl.\n\nThe service was abysmal - my waiter took 10 minutes to recognize I d sat down. He was very kind  but only dropped my food off. No  how s it going   no water refills  no offer of dessert or other courses. A kind busboy kept refilling my drink. \n\nThe portions are extremely small - I ve never seen such tiny sushi rolls in my life. The menu says there s a charge for fried rice instead of white. Huh. Jimmy Wan s offers white and brown  no extra charge. Interesting.\n\nThe atmosphere was atrocious.  A family in the table to my left and in front let their child (6 or 7  mind you) take off his shoes and walk around. He then ground his heel into the carpet - with a piece of chicken in between. He swiped a cloth napkin from an empty table and rubbed it all over his feet. I audibly gasped  but his obese mother couldn t hear me or ignored me. Then she threatened to take each of their Kindles away if they didn t shut up. The boy was eating with salad tongs instead of a fork all night long.\n\nThe waitstaff saw what was happening and didn t care at all. My waiter didn t show up after I was finished with my meal and when he did (after I d requested someone else get him) he failed to clear my dirty plates. I finally told the owner how terrible the whole thing was - namely the ambiance and the service and she asked if I wanted anything to go and apologized for being busy. You...think I want something to go? How were 15 people in the 50 seat restaurant and one small takeout order. How....is that busy?\n\nOther reviews have mentioned that the ownership has changed hands. If you care about your health  don t go to a restaurant where the waitstaff doesn t care if children grind chicken into the carpet. If they find that behavior outside of the kitchen normal  can you imagine what they do inside the kitchen? I have no doubt little handwashing goes on and much wiping of noses while cooking.\n\nJews  don t go here on Christmas  even if though they loudly advertise they re open. If 15 people means they re  busy   can you imagine what it ll be like on Christmas?\n\nThe slowness of the whole establishment is astounding. I dropped my little brother off at Jimmy Wan s immediately before going to TaiPei - a 15 second drive between establishments. Wan s parking lot was jam packed and he ate with 9 other friends. He called me to pick him up as I was paying the bill. How the hell did TaiPei take as long as Jimmy Wan s did to seat and serve and bill 10 people as they did me  the 15th person in their restaurant?\n\nOnly go here if you have a death wish or are a practicing masochist. 
y,They take great care of our pets here. We rarely have much of a wait  and all of the staff are courteous and talented in handling and caring for pets. All of the vets we have met with were professional  friendly  and very capable. 
y,Excellent food with great service. 
n,Okay food.  Number of other guests is often zero - uncomfortable. 
y,Says they deliver on here... Wrong & wrong again & should not be checked! I like Applebee s & thought the delivery was something new for the Pittsburgh area... Don t know if this is something Yelp does or something someone checked off... But not cool! 
n,This hotel is in need of a renovation. This becomes most apparent when you look at the bathrooms  which have fixtures and mildew growth both from the seventies. I ve stayed in motels that were cleaner and better appointed.\n\nI could have done without the Sleep Number bed  but that s probably more of a personal preference than anything. However  it appeared to me that the money would have been better spent on updating the rooms themselves. Apparently it used to be a Marriott some time ago - I m guessing they decided to drop the brand rather than update to Marriott s standards.\n\nThe continental breakfast was a crime. $12 for buffet style eggs (from a bag no less)  sausage  french toast  and oily potato cubes they were trying to say were home fries is unconscionable. Passing on this gastronomic atrocity  I decided to invest my money in an english muffin and two 4 oz. yogurts (only option is Strawberry Banana? Really?).\n\nAt least there was a pretty nice pool where we could... oh  closed for private party. Just as well.\n\nThankfully this was a business trip and the client is paying expenses  otherwise I might have actually felt upset. 
n,Waited for last hotel bus which scheduled before 1pm from Conventional center to hotel from 12:40 to 1:00 pm. No bus showed up  I called Front desk  they told me be patient.  I waited and called them again around 1:30pm  they hang up my phone after I explained the purpose of the phone call. I called them third time around 1:35pm  no response.  Hope they will improve quality of their service. 
n,Perhaps it was an off night  but we were really disappointed in our take-out. My husband s pork fried rice was not fried rice...still don t know what it was. His Gen. Tso s chicken was flat and my cashew chicken was flavorless. In the past it has been good food. 
y,I live about 5 minutes from Belmont  thus I do most of my shopping there as opposed to heading into the city itself (and lets face it  going down Wilkinson toward uptown isn t exactly the best place to shop!).  I mix up my groceries between Harris Teeter  Walmart  and Bi-Lo.  This Bi-Lo in particular usually has a lot of helpful folks  it s very conveniently located and is open all the time.  I prefer the deli here over Walmart lets say and you can usually get a lot of items on sale that are cheaper than Walmart as well - but not a lot of the stuff that isn t on sale.  If you are looking for a grocery store in and around Belmont  this is probably the best place to go. 
n,Wanted something close and my husband suggested Sub Corral so we gave it another shot.  I called in the order and the man/boy that took the order was not friendly at all no thank you just a  give me 20 minutes  and hung up.   The food was AWFUL.  I got the meatball sub and it was nasty (unedible) and the pizza was not good.  I will never go again.  I used to drive 20 minutes to get this pizza but now living in Belmont I will not even drive 5 minutes for it.  So dissapointing.
