1,Decided to try again. I don't know why. Pizza is actually okay but the service is so inadequate that can't endorse this place. The cashier didn't give correct change and simply can't be bothered with customers and last time I had no cheese on my pizza. Guess I'll go out of my way to Humble Pie next time.
2,What a brilliant place!\n\nI almost didn't write this review so as not to let such a sublime secret become less of a secret.\nIt's a bar within a bar.\n\nIt's inside The Commonwealth which for me is a mildly interesting but in the end not much more than a generic hipster joint full of over-hormoned yahoos and too much negative space and negative intelligence.\n\nBut for those who are never want to be  on the radar  who like to be zen and unseen  it's worth walking through the Commonwealth circus to get to The Laundry Room which by comparison is quiet thoughtful sophisticated expensive and refreshing.\n\nI can't wait to go back.
2,Place was awesome this past Friday night! Our party of six had a great time and would go again every time we go to Vegas!
1,Went for dinner on 2/1/13.  Not many new restaurants open here in Queen Creek so we looked forward to something different.  We were greatly disappointed.\n\nWe were greeted by a friendly young man who took our order at the counter which we had to repeat a couple of times because he was apparently distracted. After he had totaled our bill I asked about the availability of greens.  He said they did in fact have them available and then proceeded to close our tab not even bothering to ask if I wanted to add them same response to BF's inquiry about mac n cheese.\n\nWe both ordered fried catfish dinners which came with  critters  Hanzy's version of jazzed up hushpuppies and choice of 2 sides.  Between us we chose fries potato salad and coleslaw.  My BF placed an order for 6 of their spicy wings.\n\nAs instructed we proceeded to a table to await our food.  And wait we did. It took a good half hour before our orders arrived. Considering we were one of only 3 tables of customers when we arrived this was an excessive amount of time. Fries were cold  critters  were cold chicken wings were missing and when they did arrive were not spicy.  The catfish was hot and fresh however the three small pieces were mostly cornmeal breading (see pic) certainly not worth the $40  price charged.\n\nWe ended up leaving most of our meal on the plate.  If things don't drastically change I don't see this restaurant being around in another couple of months.  I would not recommend this business.
1,Over priced takes to long and food is mediocre at best.  To bad we are always excited for new restaurants in Queen Creek. We probably won't go back.
1,Ordered takeout late-ish one night combo with two chicken tacos black beans and rice. WTH were the tacos just placed in aluminum foil and stuck in a plastic bag that also included a container with an enchilada and the other containers of the beans rice salsa and whatever else was in the order? Of course the taco shells were completely crushed.  I still ate them. Flavor-wise they were OK. Service was fine otherwise and the chips were good. Rice is kind of bland. I'd try them again but I'll make sure I specify that I'd like the tacos also in an aluminum container with a lid so that they don't get smashed.  Who serves smashed tacos??? :(
1,Thank you Lonie. I appreciate you taking the time to reply. And you know my review wasn't malicious just a factual accounting of how the visit unfolded. My brother's tip $? I wasn't aware but I think that's how he expressed his feeling of also being non-plussed. \n\nCuriously I did receive a Yelp  compliment  from a certain male related to Nosh & Swig soon after my review. This compliment simply stated  You're a bitch.  So you might want to check with your cook-husband (or other partners?) to see if they felt the need to reach out to me in that particular way. [Definitely not returning now... Who knows what would befall my food.]\n\nLastly I've had no less than 10  thank you's  from fellow Yelpers regarding my review. Safe to say that I'm not alone in wondering where the overly generous 5-star reviews are coming from. Good yelpers aren't so easily impressed. 5-stars are rare and usually hard-earned; saved for the highest level of culinary (and consumer) enjoyment.\n\nGood luck and continue with the improvements. Make sure you let the good reviews happen organically and honestly. And maybe take the Yelp keys away from whomever thinks its ok to be nasty to us patrons.
2,Look out Firefly there's a new tapas place in town. Luckily for me it's in my hood! \nTo start I've been reading the reviews on this place since day 1 yelp prompted me to my neighborhood goods. I figured the first 3-5 reviews were friends or family trying to hype this place up. Too good to be true type stuff. \nSo Of Course when I heard about Molly's UYE and with me recently becoming Elite I was TOTALLY IN! My boyfriend joined me and we arrived just a few minutes early. Overall the event part was great and I love all my new yelp friends. 5 stars for that part no doubt! My nerves were quickly settled with everyone being welcoming. \nThe food part was decent and has potential to be really good. We ordered a monte cristo good and filling but the ham inside was just eh. The chicken littles very good. The sauce was unique and addicting. The tempura veggies. 2 outta 5. Not crunchy enough n a little mushy. The albondigas. GREAT but more like over baked risotto balls to me. Either way I'd order them again. I had the special spicy noodle soup with tofu a salty spicy ramen with a few veggies. The cookie-mon at the end was the best part a gooey warm choc chop cookie with ice cream YES PLEASE!  Also tasted the truffle tots and Thai jerkey of some other yelpers enjoyed them both. I seen a few complain about the price but for all I mentioned as well as 2 of the watery strawberry lemonades (yes the ones I should have listened and not ordred) but our tab was $45 and I thought it was priced great. One of the main reasons i will return actually. I hope this place works out it's few kinks and keeps up the good work. The employees were nice the atmosphere was friendly. Excited to come again and see if I get the same attention as a stranger.
2,I would like to say that everything here is NOSHtastic and SWIGalicious. \n\nThis gem has been open for about a month. It's hard to find (especially at night) because they don't have an illuminated store front sign just yet. So keep your eyes open! \n\nThe decor is modern. Clean and simple. There are smaller booths around the restaurant that seat 2-4. Large tables are available for bigger parties. There are an ample amount of high top bar tables that seat about 3 per table. Where the high top tables and booths are you can see the open kitchen. It's a lot of fun to watch especially when they start pumping out their food. \n\nTheir food is tapas style so don't expect large dishes that fill you up with leftovers to doggy bag. Everything on their menu screams fusion. Can't really put a finger on what they're a fusion of so I'll say that they fuse flavors from all around the world! The menu itself is super adorable. They separate their items by categories: pork beef chicken seafood veggies cheese and dessert. Within each category they have around 7 or 8 dishes to choose from. \n\nEach plate is priced anywhere from $5 to about $12. I took my cousin and we were content after 4 dishes. And then we saw servers carrying plates of food to other tables and decided to order 2 more dishes. In part this was a big mistake. We had no room for dessert and became overly stuffed. \n\n- Complimentary popcorn: What a cool way to substitute your average bread and butter basket! Perfect amount of butter. \n- Sticky Bun Tacos: Fried pork belly pickled cabbage and ginger soy. The pork belly wasn't greasy. I personally think this dish would be better if the pork was shredded. Total of 3 small tacos. \n- Albondigas: Meatballs with salsa roja with sliced jalapenos. Even without the jalapenos there's a kick of heat in the sauce.\n- Brulee Salmon Skewers. Three pieces of salmon on a stick with a honey miso glaze and a side of warm Japanese cabbage salad. I thought the honey miso glaze tasted a lot like regular teriyaki sauce.\n-Pretzel Brats: 2 mini sandwiches - chicken sausage with cheese gravy and sauerkraut on pretzel bread. This was my fave hands down. \n- Cremini caps: Mushroom caps filled with asiago cream and caramelized onions. For all you mushroom lovers this is a very yummy appetizer. I can sit and muNch on these babies all day.\n - Tater Tots with truffle oil and parmesan cheese: the tots are super crispy on the outside with a soft and tender potatoey goodness on the inside. Truffle oil taste on every bite. I can munch on these all day too. \n\nShout out to Groupon for making this trip possible! Although Nosh & Swig is clear across town from my house I'll be back to nosh and swig some more.
2,Great food!  I am definitely going to become a regular there
1,I was really excited to check this place out.  The menu looked pretty awesome when I checked it out online.  Reviews here to sum up seemed to be pretty mixed with one's experience tied pretty closely to ordering the right things on the menu.  Armed with knowledge gleaned from other reviews the lady and I rolled over there on a Friday night at 7:00pm.\n\nThe parking lot was a ghost town.  There were two tables being served.  Not a good sign but hey let's give it a shot.\n\nWe were immediately greeted by a friendly young guy who took us to a table of our choosing.  We were also immediately greeted by a NASTY smell in the air.  It smelled like someone dropped a deuce under a table.  Five days earlier.  This eau de outhouse permeated the entire restaurant.  I'm not the kind of guy who is up for making a big deal out of things.  I was fully prepared to try and ignore it and have some dinner.  The lady?  Not so much.\n\n Ummmm.... excuse me.  Do you smell that? \n\nOur host/server sheepishly replied  Haha... yeah I guess I'm just kind of used to it.  It comes and goes around here.  It's the whole area. \n\nNow I'm not a huge fan of the East Side in general but come on.  The parking lot smelled fresh as a daisy by comparison.  There is clearly something horribly wrong with this building and I hope that the young owners of Nosh and Swig have an attorney to help them get out of whatever ugly lease they are tied up in.  \n\nAfter he said he'd be back to take our drink orders we held our breath and made a beeline for the front door.\n\nI feel awful for them - and I hope they can get into another location.  One that doesn't smell like the parking garage of the Four Queens.  Two tables at prime time on a Friday night?  How many more Fridays can they possibly have in that space?
2,I get a lot of flack for being over-generous in my reviews. It is well deserved. I am an easy grader and I grade on a curve. But I never write flowery reviews to get free stuff. There's another reason for my madness and Nosh & Swig is a perfect example of a place needing some slack. A food snob could roll into here and completely trash the place. And I admit the edges are rough the execution is not perfect. But this place has potential and it has SOUL. What I mean by soul is the owner was there on a slow Weds night (it was just me this guy and another couple) and he was chatting it up at the bar.  I just assumed he was the bartender but then he started recommending stuff on the menu and talking about the recipes. Wow. It was obvious this guy loves what he does and has a passion for his business. \n\nThe DRINK: They have a good drink menu and it seems they have a full  bar . I guess the better way to describe it is they served hard liquor. I got their non-alcoholic blueberry mint lemonade and it was delicious. It was huge (I couldn't finish the whole thing) served in a mason jar with a side of crack popcorn. Seriously the stuff was so addictive I believe he does sprinkle crack on it. \n\nThe FOOD: I was starving so I didn't read up on Yelp reviews when I came here. I thought it was just another Nevada style pub. Noep. It definitely has a bar-feel especially with the owner chatting it up with the locals but I'd say it's more a casual restaurant that serves tapas. I got their elotes with garlic butter and cilantro. AMAZING! I eaten my share of elotes but these are different. The sauce they smother it in is pure tantric sex. Yeah.. that's right. \n\nNext I got a side of nachos o'brien (peppered pork.house potato chips dublin cheddar. stewed tomatoes ) and a side of Korean BBQ wings (kimchi spiced chicken Shoyu reduction). The nachos were ok but the chicken wings were good nice contrast of sweet and spicy. \n\nThings I didn't like were the chairs they were too low for the  bar . The prices are a tad high for what you get but they do have happy hour Tues-Sat from 3-6. I have no idea what that entails call to see what they offer. And the food got a little messy. It's beautifully presented but difficult to eat. \n\n+stars for the great friendly service the innovative menu and just an overall vibe of awesomeness. I want to come back and try their Dr. Pepper ribs. That sounds amazing.
2,3.5 really - but I'll round up 'cause I'd like them to do well.\n\nHere's the deal. \nI had three small plates and a cocktail. \n\nThe cocktail (Sake Long Time) was light and refreshing and the little lychee balls that popped in my mouth were tasty and fun. It's been so long since anything has popped in my mouth... \n\nbut I digress...\n\nTwo of the small plates (a nightly special - Blue Crab Spring Roll and the Asian Crepes) were quite good. The dishes were well-prepared and tasty.\n\nThe third plate - the Chicken Pretzel Brat - was pretty standard. Just okay.\n\nAll together the meal cost about $40 with tip.\n\nAnd there's my issue. For $40 I felt like I was on the low end of  enough .\nYes I appreciate the fresh ingredients as well as the inventive preparation - but when I can get good All-You-Can-Eat sushi nearby for $30 total; ...well I'm more likely to go for that. \n\nI'm not a quantity-over-quality guy and I don't need to gorge to be happy - but the balance needs to be a bit more in favor of portion size before I can justify being a regular at Nosh & Swig. \n\nGlad I tried it. Hope they do well at this location.
1,Disappointing! Turned away without even trying after driving 25 minutes to try for the 1st time. It's 9:15 sign says close at 10p.  We decided to close early today  #FalseAdvertising
2,Food is always good at the KFC on Aliante Pkwy and 215 :)
2,I stand corrected. After my initial bad visit-- they called me and asked me to return. I did so-- and met both owner and manager- very nice and had a wonderful massage by Cassandra.
1,I made an appointment by coming in earlier in the week and was given a confirmation card. The front desk personnel said they would confirm the next day. I didn't get a phone call the next day and so I called. They confirmed the time ....I'm waiting now as I do this review they are already 15 minutes behind schedule and I came in 15 minutes before my scheduled time to do paperwork. While I sit here they already told another couple to return and offers free services to them because their person was running late. Sigh I really wanted the massage and as I talk to the front desk person she is unsure how long the personnel will take therefore I must leave....it's been 25 minutes. I do not recommend! Charlotte has several great places don't be fooled by the location of this company being in South Park (which is typically reliable) they unfortunately aren't.
2,I have now been here multiple times and each time the food is better and better.  \n\nI can't speak for a variety of foods but I can say that the Pho is some of the best that I have ever had.\n\nIt is served with the traditional accompaniments of hoisin sriracha  hot peppers bean sprouts lime cilantro and thai basil as well as culantro which I had not had before (sort of like a milder cilantro).\n\nThe service is always excellent and the prices are competitive with the other restaurants in the area. \n\nI will definitely be back and often!
1,It took 30 minutes to seat the 2 of us and then another 20 minutes just to get the waiter/waitress attention for water. I wasn't pleased with the weird smell when you walk to the back.\nPrice is ok but food is not good. I ordered the pho and my noodle was super al dente. I didn't have enough toppings that came with it either. The dumplings we ordered seemed like grocery frozen ones that they just reheated and fried. Super unorganized as well. We immediately asked for the check when they brought us the food and it arrived when we were finishing up.
1,Please keep in mind we went during it's first week of being open and I am not trying to be mean by giving it only 2 stars.  The waitress was very nice and she explained that the menu was still not complete and they had big plans of expanding.\nBuuuut having said that it was a complete let down. \n1. they should not be advertised as korean bbq.  \ni am a huge korean bbq fan and this was no korean bbq by any standard.  it was completely americanized. the food came already made. you didn't grill it yourself at the table.  the rice was hard.  the bolgogi and kalbi were nothing close to any real korean bbq I've ever had (granted I'm comparing it to new york los angeles and seoul).  my first tip off that this place wasn't going to be authentic should have been the name.\n2. they served the bibimbap in a regular dish rather than a sizzling hot cast iron/stone one\ni've traditionally seen the bibimbap served in really hot dishes so when you mix everything the egg gets cooked in w/everything and you get that crispy layer at the bottom.  another bummer of the night.\non the plus side....\nthe staff was young and friendly and the main chef/part owner came to our table himself (i think he was the only asian person working there).\nthe restaurant is in a nice area and was cozy.\nbottom line...\nif you're looking for authentic korean bbq go elsewhere.\nif you're looking for a cozy trendy place to meet up w/some friends for drinks and edamame this place will do.
1,The food is overpriced and not like any Korean BBQ I've ever had. The front of the restaurant looks pretty cool tho
1,The staff has no personality and the atmosphere is stale. The food is lacking anything that truly sets it apart. We ordered tempura  Mahi Mahi bites that were supposed to come with oyster cocktail sauce and it was just a ramekin full of ketchup! I went back for a 2nd time just to make sure that  my feelings about the restaurant weren't  just a fluke and I have to say that they weren't. Again the staff was lacking in personality and the food was just ok. All in all I probably won't go back.
1,Since there's not many korean restaurant in Charlotte we thought we give this place a try in Noda. \n\nIt's a big open dinner room design when u walk in the bar is at the left the kitchen at the back and there's u have a ur whole dinner area with clear view of the street.\n\nI knew we made the wrong decision looking for authentic korean food here. Nobody works here is korean! But we stick to our plan and dine in. \n\nWe have calamari for appetizer then bibimbop and bulgogi for entree. The food is not bad if u never tried real korean food before but it's just a bit westernized. I wouldn't go back if I'm craving korean food but stop by for a drink and hang out with friends...
2,This place is better than the reviews for sure we had two sushi rolls and the app Chap Jae. Really different but really good. Great addition to Noda!
1,Everything served in or on styrofoam tasteless overpriced.  My refrigerator has a bad smell in it from the leftovers:-(
1,My new favorite place! Best Chinese food in town. I first ordered food here out of convenience but am now hooked!\n\nI love their lunch specials. Great price for great food. I love their fast service. I called in a lunch special and was told it would be ready in 10mins. I arrived early expecting to wait and my food was being out into a bag as I walked in. And they have excellent customer service.\n\nUnfortunately after I wrote this review I had a change of heart. I waited over 20 mins for 1 orange chicken special. I wouldn't be bother by the wait except when others are out before me. After I ordered my food about 7 mins later two people came in and ordered the exact same thing I had. 5 mins later they walk out with their food. Soon a few more people walk in and place their orders and they got their food within mins. Finally I was handed my 1 simple order of orange chicken. Don't think I'll be coming here as often as I planned.
2,Andrea and George are the bomb!  Used them for both boarding and day care and felt very comfortable leaving our (2) dogs in their facility.  George also helped socialize our Doberman and made him comfortable with other dogs during their visits.  We drove 30+ minutes one way to visit these guys primarily because they are one of the few kennel/cage free facilities in Vegas but grew to trust them completely with our babies. Our dogs could not wait to go to K9 and it became a home away from home for them.\n\nThanks George and Andrea for taking such good care of our pups! Best of luck with expansion plans. \n\nHighly recommended!\n\nTodd & Sandra
1,I'm just gonna have to stop and call this place out.\n\nFirst I typically love $2 tacos. I'm all about that. But this place is scum.\n\nWe waited in line for 20 minutes. Not because the guy was helping another customer...no he was replacing cheese that didn't need to be replaced. It was like half full. Second  after he replaced the cheese he stuck some in his mouth and started eating it with his gloved hands. After the cheese he decided the ketchup bottles needed replacing too. All the while me and everyone behind me are watching this guy and getting more and more pissed.\n\nAfter we called him out on that to change his gloves after sticking it in his mouth he decided to be a jerk and stick the hottest salsa they have on our tacos. I asked for mild not suicide hot. Couldn't even eat my damn taco.\n\nI am so pissed.
1,So judging from the rest of the reviews I guess I caught them on a bad day.  A day bad enough for food poisoning.  I don't think I would return even if it was free.  meh.
2,This was a great experience!  Service by TJ (also known as JT) was fabulous!!  Salad was great and prices were very reasonable.\n\nWill definitely come here again when back at the airport!
2,Nicky's used to be my little secret.  But with a creative menu and a stunning garden Nicky's has really taken off.  It's a little harder to get a table there now so it's smart to make a reservation these days.  \n\nI have had many wonderful meals here the food is very good.  I particularly like the mango dishes the scallops the spring rolls and the curries.  Excellent Thai food in a beautiful setting.  I recommend that you eat outside the garden is stunning.
1,Let me start off by saying this place had a steady retained customer until they showed their true colors... I absolutely loved their crab fried rice and greasy soup until one afternoon I ordered their soup with half cooked fish which was absolutely nauseating... I waited for my order over one hour when I order an hour before the food was prepared... The hostest has to be a complete idiot because when I came to pick up my food she kept telling oh it'll be a few minutes after waiting an hour I left after paying for my food. I told this goof troop that I'll be back for my money and a word with the manager once I get off of work. So I called in one of my rant fits and the hostest said 'Ohhh your Sarena it's been sitting here since you paid' I mean really wtf... You took my money but kept playing the wait game. I was infuriated asked one of my co-workers to pick up the food... After all the waiting the sugar honey iced tea was horrid... Never again
2,I ate at Niky's last evening.  Like a dumb bunny I never thought to make reservations and the place was packed.  They found seating for us and a late arrival guest with in 10 minutes.  What can I say the food came out quick and it was delicious!  My first guest had never eaten there before and he ordered the duck.  He raved about it!  My TY Soup and the S&S Chicken was excellent!  My late arrival guest had the Chicken Mango Salad.  He was scraping the plate!
1,Went to breakfast a couple of weeks ago with friends. It wasn't anything to write an awesome review about. I had the egg/mushroom omelet. I was a little runny but I think it was because they got my order wrong the first time and rushed to make me another. I might go back and try other things but it's also a bit over-priced so maybe not. When there are endless choices of breakfast places I would go back if others were going there. I probably wouldn't suggest it.
2,This is a good little spot. The coffee was delicious; my wife had a peach mimosa that she really liked.  It buzzed her up good.  I had the French toast and my wife had a Mediterranean omelet and they were both tasty.  The French toast was some of the best French toast I have ever had the butter was awesome.  It was a really good meal and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.  So now that I have recommended Over/Easy based only on the food I have to commend the manager for taking care of his customers.  I bought this living social coupon without reading the fine print my bad I'm sure we've all been there and I wasn't supposed to be able to use it at the Gilbert Over/Easy the coupon was for the Mesa Over/Easy.  I explained that I came all the way from Phoenix because I couldn't use my living social at the Phoenix Over/Easy and Jeff the manager worked with me and applied a credit to my bill even though it was my mistake.  That's quality service that will keep me coming back.  I just had to let folks know the food was good and that is the most important but the service was accommodating even though I was in the wrong and that's something every service oriented business should provide  Be good to people who keep the business going and they will come back.  Good food great service.  I'll definitely be back.
1,I was really looking forward to eating at the establishment based on verbal reviews from friends. Usually I never review a restaurant after the  first look  my standard is 3 visits but I felt since my two guests have both been here and were very positive I would give it a go. \n\nWe chose to go on a Friday at noon hoping for fewer customers and perhaps better service. Our decision was correct as far as fewer customers only 4 other tables hopes were high and quickly dashed. Our less than enthusiastic server Mariela acted as if we were bothering her by our mere presence. When my dining companions ordered ice water only you could see  the annoyance in the server's face however when I ordered an over priced coffee drink she seemed to perk up.  Thus began our dining experience.\n\nMy friends and I ordered Eggs Benedict-Florentine with home fries The Tammy breakfast sandwich with sweet potato tots and the Ham Steak with red eye gravy two over hard hard hard eggs and hash browns I duly emphasized  hard on the over hard.\n\nThe wait for the food was adequate. \nThe food arrived; the presentation on the Florentine and the Tammy was nicely done and my friend was very happy with the flavor of the hollandaise many times hollandaise is not lemony enough however I noticed the sauce did not stick to the eggs and dripped to the bottom of the plate leaving the english muffin bathed in a sea of sauce...ewww obviously not properly prepared probably did not cook eggs and reduction long enough before adding butter. The home fries did not look very appetizing and my friend did not touch them.\n\nNo comments on the Tammy sandwich positive or negative the sweet potato tots were fine.\n\nNow we come to the disaster. If you are familiar with Ham steak and red eye gravy  you know that it is generally a 3/4 inch slice of pan seared ham (preferably seared in a cast iron pan) with a sauce which consists of hot coffee added to the pan juices and emulsified with  cold butter. What I received was an 1/8  slice of processed deli ham which had been quickly thrown onto a flat top barely any caramelization on the ham and no sauce on top. I received the sauce a few minutes later in a plastic portion cup. This was not a properly made red eye gravy I am going to assume it was a bottled imitation. The hash browns were undercooked and cold in the middle and the worst part of the meal yes it gets worse the eggs were still gooey in the middle not over hard. When I spoke to our utterly unenthusiastic server Mariela her only response was  Um.. oh...well do you want more eggs?  I replied no because I had lost my taste for them at that point. \n\nSo to summarize the meal was disappointing and when the eggs were sent back the server should have at least offered to take a couple of bucks off the check as a good measure. The service was lack luster and the server was more interested in flirting with the manager than attending to her tables. I left starving and frustrated.\n\nI recommend if you choose to try this restaurant do so with low expectations.\nI will try two more visits and see if they can redeem themselves. I am a three strikes out kind of person so until my next review.  Chow Chow
1,Was sat and once our waitress was reminded about us she admitted she forgot about us. Food quality poor. Hash browns were crunchy not crispy. Will not return
1,been here a few times with the wife because they have decent morning happy hour on beer and mimosas but this time I didn't partake and I have to say this place is not as enchanting if you aren't plied with booze.  most frustrating was the crappy service and the fact that the server threw another server under the bus and said they were extra busy because someone else didn't show for their shift.  guess what as a customer I don't care if your service is terrible because the cook is banging a Martian on the grill - just be professional and apologize and manage my perception appropriately.  I was super embarrassed for the manager to have such uncouth employees working at this location.
1,Not very good or fresh tasting. It's also really pricey. I wanted to like this place for my occasional chili dog/hot dog craving. The bread was not soft/steamed that's a problem. The hot dog had a good snap but wasn't awesome tasting.\n\nIt just isn't good which is too bad because it was rare meal eating a hot dog (grew up in Chicago use to have often Portillos is the bomb) and I wasted it on this place. \n\nAbout three years ago I tried the Pinks at Planet Hollywood it was better than this experience but I just remember how pricey it was.
1,We went to this newly opened restaurant with high hope as its advertised manual showed all famous dishes from the Shaanxi province in western China. Unfortunately our enthusiasm was quickly diminished by the poorly prepared/cooked dishes. The chief over used spices to hide the poor quality lamb meat he used in the dishes. The BBQ lamb was so tough that was not eatable. Ground lamb was used instead of whole piece of lamb to reduce cost for the owner.The service was very poor as well by the inexperienced water and waitresses. I have to say we will not go back to this place once was enough.\n\nI wrote the review for this restaurant when it had an address close by now the owner tweaked it into a new place but it is the same place.
2,I have the best boss in the world; he is the ultimate foodie so when he takes me out to dinner we always end up at great places. \n\nThis place apparently had only been open for 10 days when we visited. We had a 9pm reservation and arrived 15 min prior to have drinks. \n\nWalking in there was a crowd right by the door. I lightly pushed my way through and came face to face with Steve Wynn. Yes that guy. Then I heard a familiar voice looked to the right and it was George Clooney. Ok we are off to an interesting start.  There was an entourage of about 20 people so we had to wait for an hour before we were seated -and this was with a reservation at 9!!  So we didn't even get to sit down until nearly 10pm. The people watching was interesting and the ambiance at the place was very hip.\n\nThe food was good. I had the misoyaki cod which is always good doesn't matter where you go. The appetizers were just okay and they weren't flexible to changes. \n\nWould I come here again? Not at these prices on my own dime. But if the boss is paying? Absolutely. Who knows who I would see next time.
2,Cool new venue! \n\nOnly been open for a few months but Andrea's is a perfect fit into the Encore's line of fine dining. The ambiance is very chique and hip great list of wines and cocktails and excellent food choices. We had a large partry (10+) and they were very accomodating. We tried a bunch of little plates / appitizers and they were all delicious (the Wagyu Beef Tataki was my personal fave).  For dinner I had the Seared Ahi salad (delicious) and the Wagyu Rib Cap (most flavorful steak I've had in months) - however it was only 6 oz....which is kinda small. \n\nCome here hungry cuz almost everything sounds delicious and their dessert menu is something you don't want to skip! (we tried the trio sampler and all three were awesome).
2,Amazing time with the hubby tonight at Andrea's. They even had my name on my chopsticks! Great food drinks and service. And you have to get the mochi ice cream and cheese cake bites for dessert wonderful way to finish the night.
1,Ok so I have NEVER left a yelp review before in my life! We tried to have dinner at Andreas and were willing to sit in the cocktail lounge because we did not make reservation. The hostess told us it was first come first served so we grabbed a table only to be told that since we were (the guys) wearing shorts that we couldn't dine there. I'm sorry but I work at one of the highest grossing restaurants in the country (in NYC) and people can walk into there wearing whatever they want! We are in fucking Las Vegas get over yourselves honestly!!!!
2,If you like high quality sushi this place is for you. Don't get me wrong it is pricey. But if you're in Las Vegas it's worth it to enjoy a nice dinner. The ambiance is beautiful with the chandeliers tables and chairs. The windows on one side overlook the pool. Everything we had was amazing. We had a few sushi items as appetizers including the albacore sashimi with crispy onions and soup. My entr\u00e9e was the sea bass which was cooked to perfection. The desserts were unbelievable we had a combination of three different ice creams and fruit with shaved ice which was prepared at the table. The staff were very courteous and respectful. I definitely recommend Andrea's if you enjoy fine dining.
2,It's never too late to deliver GOOD SERVICE. I ordered a piece of workout equipment a few days ago and today @ 10:12am -- it was delivered via an ON TRAC Courier. I was under the impression the parcel would be coming via FED EX but somehow it was ON TRAC (and 2-6 days ahead of estimation). \n\nIf you read my review of 9-months ago then you know I was in no way looking forward to using their services [ever] based on their  random transit behavior  in residential traffic (on my street). However today was different.  I can't say enough about the kindness of the gentleman courier who delivered my parcel today. He rang the door bell and was exiting my lawn by the time I got to the door. As he entered his van he looked back and noticed that I was a female he then yelled from the cab \n\n It's pretty heavy. Would you like me to take it inside for you?  \n Oh no!  I said  Thanks anyway.  \nHis response  Well I'm from the South it's not a problem I love to help.  \n\nSOUTHERN CHARM wins every time. \n\nI 'skidaddled' (quickly tip toed across my lawn) over to the truck and said  Me too... . He said he was from Arkansas and continued to offer his services of carrying my  package inside. How kind of him. I looked at his van and said  ON TRAC huh? I can't wait to write a review on your safe delivery and awesome customer service.  \n\n#WORD kept. I love writing POSITIVE REVIEWS. Thank you On Trac for giving me the  opportunity to do so on your behalf. :-)
1,Like most people I would leave a  0  star if they yelp had the option. Ordered a brand new $220.00 router from Newegg on Monday that was supposed to arrive on  Wednesday. Usually Fed ex  and UPS come by later in the day so when I saw the UPS guy around 4:00 I thought maybe  my package was  delivered. I checked the front door  and no package. I checked the tracking  number from  newegg which said  the package was delivered by Ontrac to the front door  at 1:25 p.m. Funny thing is I  was home in my kitchen at that time  and never received a  knock on the door or  a  ring  from  the door bell. I had a family member come over at 1:45 p.m. in which I opened the same front door in which I never saw  any package. \nI don't remember ever having packages  shipped  by this  company before  so I  hope this  is  the first and last time I have a package with them because odds  are  you  might not receive it. I called Ontrac and filed a  complaint because the driver says he supposedly delivered it to my door and I filed a claim with newegg. I will be issued a new router but I will  now have to wait longer to  get my item because my claim will take  several days plus additional  shipping days. I went online and saw that many people have the same problem with this company. I'm surprised  there still in business. Just look up Ontrac in California and you will see  nothing but complaints.
1,We stayed at this hotel the room was very very dirty the bed was stained the pillows had yellow stains the refrigerator was broken with pieces  missing carpet stained furniture stained and the microwave was never cleaned worst motel 6 I've stayed at.
2,We'll organized and great prices! I love that items are clearly priced & displayed neatly. The store was clean and we'll maintained. A slightly funky smell as you entered but it went away or I got used to it LOL huge clothing selection organized by size & color! I wish they had more furniture but it guess that all depends on peoples donation. Plus they have a special color of the day that's 50% off. It's definitely priced cheaper than Goodwill & Savers. Overall good spot to thrift.... Plus great tunes playing while shopping!! Nice Rockin' oldies!
1,Service could have been better. Curry nothing to remember. Sushi was blah. Katsu seemed like it was leftovers that was re fried. Was really hoping it would be great spot since I live so close by but I won't be returning.
2,I've only been here a couple times but it's definitely nice for a casino that's way off the strip. Everything feels new and clean and the air isn't too smoky. \n\nI was there on a long holiday weekend. My only major gripe was they didn't have enough tables open. Sometimes gamblers want a variety. If I'm not doing well on one blackjack table I might want to switch to another. They did have $5 min. tables which was surprising during the holidays though.\n\nDrink service was also pretty slow. It took about half an hour to get the drink I ordered which is pretty slow considering there weren't many players at the time.
2,Hate to admit but im becoming a regular here! LOL! overall a nice casino! clean plenty of machines and they even have a bingo room! not sure why they have a celebrity parking section on the second deck....have yet to spot any celebs! but i like it! close to home with good restaurants and a movie theater!
1,Poor service at the deck pool! Paid $10 to get in as locals and waited over 30 mins for anyone to see if we wanted food or drinks. We asked for a menu and no one ever came back to take our order. The pool could use more water so all the jets are not spraying water across the pool. Hope for better service at The Salted Lime for dinner cause starving after no service at the pool.
2,Nice looks like the M resort / interior / cute little casino up north! I'll be back for sure!
1,This review is based on my pool experience.  The pool is beautiful but the service lacks. The worst of my experience is my 2 year old hearing a male bartender swearing then repeating what she heard. I don't think I will be returning and I recommend not bringing young kids unless you're ok with your kids hearing swear words.
2,I had the experience to have a manicure and facial at the Aliante Relax Spa located in the Aliante hotel. What a treat the spa is warm friendly and offer too amazing procedures to list. This spa is the cleanest I've been. They even have champagne with the 85 minute pedicure what a bonus!  The staff is very professional. Escorted me to the private dressing area where I was given a cozy robe and relaxed in their relax room. They also provided bottled wAtet fresh fruit and other snacks and beverages. If you have the opportunity please visit the spa as you will not be disappointed.
1,Stopped in for a latte and a breakfast sandwich.  Jaw nearly hit the floor when told total was over $12.50 so I expected a good sandwich for that price!  Nope got a pre-made microwaved sandwich that was no bigger than a slider.  Small hot latte was $4.25.  Skip this place!
1,Meh. Is about the perfect way to describe this place. First it's too expensive (I know it's Vegas on the Strip but improve quality if you're going to have such high cost). Food was okay at best. With so many other places at all different price ranges no need to eat at this one.
1,Goodness.......... Possibly first bad review I've given on yelp. Manager was incredibly RUDE. Apparently you don't matter as a customer if you are close to their closing time. Can't believe the rudeness of this supervisor when asked simple questions. Will not return.
1,Absolutely disgusting and filthy; health dept needs called. No customer service. Saw 3 Asian men sitting around in the back watching tv. Get off your ads and run your pathetic business!
1,Our gym is located just down the street from the place and we have been watching the hard work they have been putting into building the place and making what was once an eye sore to a wonderful and clean looking establishment. When my husband and I finally noticed the place we had watched develop was open for customers we were excited. We often do not go out to eat we would rather eat in but we had to try this place maybe because we were super excited and made it out to be more in our minds but on the day we went in it was one disapointment after another :(. I will give the place on how clean and nice it looks 5 stars but the salsa..although freash it lacked flavor and most of them were so hot you couldnt even taste your food over the heat in your mouth :( The meat (beef) was so greasy and lacked flavor that unless you put a tons of lime on it it was very unenjoyable to eat :( The price was high and the portions small and the chips and salsa I belive are the same chips I could buy from the local market :( Also we could not find one napkin in the whole place and the service although kind was very unorganized. We do not want to be 100% negative again we give the owners 5 stars for making an establishment look so wonderful in Mesa that was once an eye sore but wish that more money would go into less grease and more flavor all around:) -two mesa people :)
